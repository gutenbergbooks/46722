<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been

<p>Modern practice in Italian texts contracts (removes the space from)

This book, in common with some similar English books of the time, has
a space in these elisions in the original text.  This space has been

<h2 class="pg-brk"><a href="#CONTENTS">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">It</span> might seem proper, in England at least, to preface
any book dealing frankly with the author of the
<cite>Decameron</cite> with an apology for, and perhaps a
defence of, its subject. I shall do nothing of the
kind. Indeed, this is not the place, if any be, to undertake
the defence of Boccaccio. His life, the facts of his
life, his love, his humanity, and his labours, plentifully set
forth in this work, will defend him with the simple of
heart more eloquently than I could hope to do. And it
might seem that one who exhausted his little patrimony
in the acquirement of learning, who gave Homer back to
us, who founded or certainly fixed Italian prose, who was
the friend of Petrarch, the passionate defender of Dante,
and who died in the pursuit of knowledge, should need no
defence anywhere from any one.</p>

<p>This book, on which I have been at work from time to
time for some years, is the result of an endeavour to set
out quite frankly and in order all that may be known of
Boccaccio, his life, his love for Fiammetta, and his work, so
splendid in the Tuscan, the fruit of such an enthusiastic and
heroic labour in the Latin. It is an attempt at a biographical
and critical study of one of the greatest creative
writers of Europe, of one of the earliest humanists, in
which, for the first time, in England certainly, all the facts
are placed before the reader, and the sources and authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
for these facts quoted, cited, and named. Yet while I
have tried to be as scrupulous as possible in this respect,
I hope the book will be read too by those for whom notes
have no attraction; for it was written first for delight.</p>

<p>Among other things I have dealt with, the reader will
find a study of Boccaccio's attitude to Woman, and in some
sort this may be said to be the true subject of the book.</p>

<p>I have dealt too with Boccaccio's relation to both
Dante and Petrarch; and it was my intention to have
written a chapter on Boccaccio and Chaucer, but interesting
as that subject is&mdash;and one of the greatest desiderata
in the study of Chaucer&mdash;a chapter in a long book
seemed too small for it; and again, it belongs rather
to a book on Chaucer than to one about Boccaccio. I
have left it, then, for another opportunity, or for another
and a better student than myself.</p>

<p>In regard to the illustrations, I may say that I hoped to
make them, as it were, a chapter on Boccaccio and his
work in relation to the fine arts; but I found at last that
it would be impossible to carry this out. To begin with,
I was unable to get permission to reproduce M. Spiridon's
and Mr. V. Watney's panels by Alunno di Domenico<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
illustrating the story of Nastagio degli Onesti (<cite>Decameron</cite>,
V, 8), which are perhaps the most beautiful paintings ever
made in illustration of one of Boccaccio's tales. In the second
place, the subject was too big to treat of in the space at
my command. I wish now that I had dealt only with
the <cite>Decameron</cite>; but in spite of a certain want of completeness,
the examples I have been able to reproduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
will give the reader a very good idea of the large and
exquisite mass of material of the fourteenth, fifteenth,
and sixteenth centuries in Italy, France, Germany, and
even in England which in its relation to Boccaccio has
still to be dealt with. Nothing on this subject has yet
been published, though something of the sort with regard
to Petrarch has been attempted. Beyond the early part
of the seventeenth century I have not sought to go, but
an examination of the work of the eighteenth century in
France at any rate should repay the student in this
untouched field.</p>

<p>I have to thank a host of people who in many and
various ways have given me their assistance in the
writing of this book. It has been a labour of love for
them as for me, and let us hope that Boccaccio "in the
third heaven with his own Fiammetta" is as grateful for
their kindness as I am.</p>

<p>Especially I wish to thank Mrs. Ross, of Poggio
Gherardo, Mr. A. E. Benn, of Villa Ciliegio, Professor
Guido Biagi, of Florence, Mr. Edmund Gardner, Professor
Henri Hauvette, of Paris, Mr. William Heywood,
Dr. Paget Toynbee, and Mr. Charles Whibley. And
I must also express my gratitude to Messrs. J. and
J. Leighton, of Brewer Street, London, W., for so kindly
placing at my disposal many of the blocks which will be
found in these pages.</p>

<h2><a href="#CONTENTS">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">Of</span> the three great writers who open the literature
of the modern world, Dante, Petrarch, and
Boccaccio, it is perhaps the last who has the
greatest significance in the history of culture,
of civilisation. Without the profound mysticism of Dante
or the extraordinary sweetness and perfection of Petrarch,
he was more complete than either of them, full at once of
laughter and humility and love&mdash;that humanism which in
him alone in his day was really a part of life. For him
the centre of things was not to be found in the next world
but in this. To the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> he seems to oppose
the Human Comedy, the <cite>Decameron</cite>, in which he not only
created for Italy a classic prose, but gave the world an
ever-living book full of men and women and the courtesy,
generosity, and humanity of life, which was to be one of
the greater literary influences in Europe during some three
hundred years.</p>

<p>In England certainly, and indeed almost everywhere
to-day, the name of Boccaccio stands for this book,
the <cite>Decameron</cite>. Yet the volumes he wrote during a
laborious and really uneventful life are very numerous
both in verse and prose, in Latin and in Tuscan. He
began to write before he was twenty years old, and he
scarcely stayed his hand till he lay dying alone in Certaldo
in 1375. That the <cite>Decameron</cite>, his greatest and most
various work, should be that by which he is most widely
known, is not remarkable; it is strange, however, that of
all his works it should be the only one that is quite impersonal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
His earlier romances are without exception <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">romans
à clef</i>; under a transparent veil of allegory he tells us
eagerly, even passionately, of himself, his love, his sufferings,
his agony and delight. He too has confessed himself
with the same intensity as St. Augustine; but we refuse
to hear him. Over and over again he tells his story. One
may follow it exactly from point to point, divide it into
periods, name the beginning and the ending of his love,
his enthusiasms, his youth and ripeness; yet we mark
him not, but perhaps wisely reach down the <cite>Decameron</cite>
from our shelves and silence him with his own words; for
in the <cite>Decameron</cite> he is almost as completely hidden from
us as is Shakespeare in his plays. And yet for all this,
there is a profound unity in his work, which, if we can but
see it, makes of all his books just the acts of a drama, the
drama of his life. The <cite>Decameron</cite> is already to be found
in essence in the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, as is the bitter melancholy of the
<cite>Corbaccio</cite>, its mad folly too, and the sweetness of the songs.
For the truth about Boccaccio can be summed up in one
statement almost, he was a poet before all things, not only
because he could express himself in perfect verse, nor
even because of the grace and beauty of all his writing,
his gifts of sentiment and sensibility, but because he is an
interpreter of nature and of man, who knows that poetry
is holy and sacred, and that one must accept it thankfully
in fear and humility.</p>

<p>He was the most human writer the Renaissance produced
in Italy; and since his life was so full and eager in
its desire for knowledge, it is strange that nothing of any
serious account has been written concerning him in
English,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and this is even unaccountable when we remember
how eagerly many among our greater poets have been
his debtors. Though for no other cause yet for this it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
be well to try here with what success the allegory of his
life may be solved, the facts set in order, and the significance
of his work expressed.</p>

<p>But no study of Boccaccio can be successful, or in any
sense complete, without a glance at the period which produced
him, and especially at those eight-and-forty years so
confused in Italy, and not in Italy alone, which lie between
the death of Frederic II and the birth of Dante in
1265 and the death of Henry VII and the birth of Boccaccio
in 1313. This period, not less significant in the
general history of Italy than in the history of her literature,
begins with the fall of the Empire, its failure, that
is, as the sum or at least the head, of Christendom; it
includes the fall of the medieval Papacy in 1303 and
the abandonment of the Eternal City, the exile of the
Popes. These were years of immense disaster in which
we see the passing of a whole civilisation and the birth
of the modern world.</p>

<p>The Papacy had destroyed the Empire but had failed
to establish itself in its place. It threatened a new
tyranny, but already weapons were being forged to combat
it, and little by little the Papal view of the world, of
government, was to be met by an appeal to history, to
the criticism of history, and to those political principles
which were to be the result of that criticism. In this work
both Petrarch and Boccaccio bear a noble part.</p>

<p>If we turn to the history of Florence we shall find that
the last thirty-five years of the thirteenth century had
been, perhaps, the happiest in her history. From the
triumph of the Guelfs at Benevento to the quarrel of
<i>Neri</i> and <i>Bianchi</i> she was at least at peace with herself,
while in her relations with her sister cities she became the
greatest power in Tuscany. Art and Poetry flourished
within her walls. Dante, Cavalcanti, Giotto, the Pisani,
and Arnolfo di Cambio were busy with their work, and the
great churches we know so well, the beautiful palaces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
the officers of the Republic were then built with pride and
enthusiasm. In 1289, the last sparks, as it was thought,
of Tuscan Ghibellinism had been stamped out at Campaldino.
There followed the old quarrel and Dante's exile.</p>

<p>The Ghibellines were no more, but the <i>Grandi</i>, those
Guelf magnates who had done so well at Campaldino,
hating the burgher rule as bitterly as the old nobility had
done, began to exert themselves. In the very year of the
great battle we find that the peasants of the <i>contrada</i> were
enfranchised to combat them. In 1293 the famous Ordinances
of Justice which excluded them from office were
passed, and the <i>Gonfaloniere</i> was appointed to enforce
these laws against them. A temporary alliance of burghers
and <i>Grandi</i> in 1295 drove Giano della Bella, the hero of
these reforms, into exile, and the government remained in
the hands of the <i>Grandi</i>. That year saw Dante's entrance
into public life.</p>

<p>The quarrel thus begun came to crisis in 1300, the
famous year of the jubilee, when Boniface VIII seemed to
hold the whole world in his hands. The dissensions in
Florence had not been lost upon the Pope, who, apparently
hoping to repress the Republic altogether and win
the obedience of the city, intrigued with the <i>Neri</i>, those
among the magnates who, unlike their fellows of the
<i>Bianchi</i> faction, among whom Dante is the most conspicuous
figure, refused to admit the Ordinances of Justice,
even in their revised form, and wished for the tyrannical
rule of the old <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Parte Guelfa</i>. Already, as was well known,
the Pope was pressing Albert of Austria for a renunciation
of the Imperial claim over Tuscany in favour
of the Holy See; and Florence, finally distracted now
by the quarrels of <i>Neri</i> and <i>Bianchi</i>, seemed to be
in imminent danger of losing her liberty. It became
necessary to redress the balance of power, destroyed at
Benevento, by an attempt to recreate the Empire.
This was the real work of the <i>Bianchi</i>&mdash;their solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
of the greatest question of their time. The actual
solution was to come, however, from their opponents:
not from the leaders of the <i>Neri</i> it is true, but from the
people themselves. These leaders were but tyrants in
disguise: they served any cause to establish their own
lordship. Corso Donati, for instance, the head and front
of the <i>Neri</i>, was of an old Ghibelline stock, yet he
trafficked with the Pope, not for the Church, we may be
sure, nor to give Florence to the Holy See, but that he
might himself rule the city. Nor did the Pope disdain to
use him. Alarmed even in Rome by the republican
sentiments of the populace, who wished to rule themselves
even as the Florentines, he desired above all things
to bring Florence into his power. On May 15, 1300,
the Pope despatched a letter to the Bishop of Florence,
in which he asked: "Is not the Pontiff supreme lord over
all, and particularly over Florence, which for especial
reasons is bound to be subject to him? Do not emperors
and kings of the Romans yield submission to us, yet are
they not superior to Florence? During the vacancy of
the Imperial throne, did not the Holy See appoint King
Charles of Anjou Vicar-General of Tuscany?" Thus as
Villari says, "in a rising <i>crescendo</i>," he threatened the
Florentines that he would "not only launch his interdict
and excommunication against them, but inflict the
utmost injury on their citizens and merchants, cause
their property to be pillaged and confiscated in all parts
of the world, and release all their debtors from the duty of
payment." The <i>Neri</i>, fearing the people might, with that
impudent claim before them, side with the <i>Bianchi</i>, induced
the Pope to send the Cardinal of Acquasparta to
arrange a pacification. But though the city gave him
many promises, she would not invest him with the Balia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Pope, set on the subjection of Florence,
without counting the cost, urged Charles of Valois, the
brother of Philip IV of France, to march into Tuscany.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Nor was Charles of Anjou, King of Naples, less eager to
have his aid against the Sicilians. Joined by the exiles in
November, 1301, he entered Florence with some 1200
horse, part French, part Italian. His mission was to
crush the <i>Bianchi</i> and the people, and to uplift the <i>Neri</i>.
He came at the request of the Pope, and, so far as he
himself was interested, for booty; yet he swore in S. Maria
Novella to keep the peace. On that same day, November
5, Corso Donati entered the city with an armed
force. The French joined in the riot, the Priors were
driven from their new palace, and the city sacked by the
soldiers with the help of the <i>Neri</i>. The Pope had succeeded
in substituting black for white, that was all. A
new "peace-maker" failed altogether. The proscription,
already begun, continued, and before January 27, 1302,
Dante went into exile.</p>

<p>But if the Pope had failed to do more than establish
the <i>Neri</i> in the government of Florence, Corso Donati
had failed also; he had not won the lordship of the city.
He tried again, splitting the <i>Neri</i> into two factions, and
Florence was not to possess herself in peace till his death
in a last attempt in 1308. It was during these years so full
of disaster that Petrarch was born at Arezzo on July 20,
1304.</p>

<p>The medieval idea of the Papacy has been expressed
once and for all by S. Thomas Aquinas. In his mind so
profoundly theological, abhorring variety, the world was
to be governed, if at all, by a constitutional monarchy,
strong enough to enforce order, but not to establish a
tyranny. The first object of every Christian society, the
salvation of the soul, was to be achieved by the priest
under the absolute rule of the Pope. Under the old
dispensation, as he admitted, the priest had been subject
to the king, but under the new dispensation the king
was subject to the priest in matters touching the law
of Christ. Thus if the king were careless of religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
or schismatic or heretical, the Church might deprive him
of his power and by excommunication release his subjects
from their allegiance. This supreme authority is vested
in the Pope, who is infallible, and from whom there can be
no appeal at any time as to what is to be believed or
what condemned.</p>

<p>Before these claims the Empire had fallen in 1266; but
a reaction, the result of the success of Boniface, soon set in,
and we find the most perfect expression of the revived and
reformed claims of the Empire in the <cite>De Monarchia</cite>, which
Dante Alighieri wrote in exile. Dante's Empire was by
no means merely a revival of what the Imperial idea had
become in its conflicts with the Holy See. It was nevertheless
as hopeless an anachronism as the dream of S.
Thomas Aquinas, and even less clairvoyant of the future,
for it disregarded altogether the spirit to which the future
belonged, the spirit of nationalism. With a mind as theological
as S. Thomas's, Dante hated variety not less than
he, and rather than tolerate the confusion of the innumerable
cities and communes into which Italy was divided,
where there was life, he would have thrust the world back
into Feudalism and the Middle Age from which it was
already emerging, he would have established over all Italy
a German king. He was dreaming of the Roman Empire.
The end for which we must strive, he would seem to say
in the <cite>De Monarchia</cite>, that epitaph of the Empire, is unity;
let that <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text was 'he granted'">be granted</ins>. And since that is the end of all
society, how shall we obtain it but by obedience to one
head&mdash;the Emperor. And this Empire&mdash;so easy is it to
mistake the past for the future&mdash;belongs of right to
the Roman people who won it long ago. And what
they won Christ sanctioned, for He was born within
its confines. And yet again He recognised it, for He
received at the hands of a Roman judge the sentence under
which He bore our sorrows. Nor does the Empire derive
from the Pope or through the Pope, but from God immediately;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
for the foundation of the Church is Christ, but
the Empire was before the Church. Yet let Cæsar be
reverent to Peter, as the first-born should be reverent to
his father.</p>

<p>So much for the philosophical defence of the reaction.
It is rarely, after all, that a rigidly logical conception of
society, of the State, has any existence in reality. The
future, as we know, lay with quite another theory. Yet
which of us to-day but in his secret heart dreams ever
more hopefully of a new unity, that is indeed no stranger
to the old, but in fact the resurrection of the Empire, of
Christendom, in which alone we can be one? After all, is
it not now as then, the noblest hope that can inspire our
lives?</p>

<p>Already, before the death of Boniface VIII, the last
Pope to die in Rome for nearly a hundred years, Philip IV
of France had asserted the rights of the State against the
claims of the Papal monarchy. The future was his, and his
success was to be so great that for more than seventy
years the Papacy was altogether under the influence
of France, the first of the great nations of the Continent
to become self-conscious. Thus when Boniface died
broken-hearted in 1303, it was the medieval Papacy which
lay in state beside him. Two years later, after the pathetic
and ineffectual nine months' reign of Benedict XI,
Clement V, Bertrand de Goth, an Aquitanian, was elected,
and, like his predecessor, fearful before the turbulent
Romans and the confusion of Italy, in 1305 fled away
to Avignon, which King Charles II of Naples held as
Count of Anjou on the borders of the French kingdom.
The Papacy had abandoned the Eternal City and
had come under the influence of the French king. Yet
in spite of every disaster the Pope and the Emperor
remained the opposed centres of European affairs. No
one as yet realised the possibility of doing without them,
but each power sought rather to use them for its own end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
In this political struggle France held the best position;
the Pope was a Frenchman and so her son; there remained
as spoil, the Empire.</p>

<p>On May 1, 1308, Albert of Hapsburg had been murdered
by his nephew; the election of a new King of the Romans,
the future Emperor, fell pat to Philip's ambitions. He
immediately supported the candidature of his brother,
Charles of Valois; but in this he reckoned without the
Pope, who with the Angevins in Naples and himself in
Avignon had no wish to see the Empire also in the hands of
France. His position forbade him openly to oppose Philip,
but secretly he gave his support to Henry of Luxemburg,
who was elected as Henry VII on 27 November, 1308.</p>

<p>A German educated in France, the lord of a petty
state, Henry, in spite of the nobility of his nature, of
which we hear so much and see so little, had but feeble
Latin sympathies and no real power of his own. He
dreamed of the universal empire like a true German,
believing that the feudal union of Germany and Italy
which had always been impossible was the future of the
world. With this mirage before his eyes he raised the
imperial flag and set out southward; and for a moment it
seemed as though the stars had stopped in their courses.</p>

<p>For he was by no means alone in his dream. Every
disappointed ambition in Italy, noble and ignoble, greeted
him with a feverish enthusiasm. The Bianchi and the
exiled Ghibellines joined hands, enormous hopes were
conceived, and in his triumph private vengeance and
public hate thought to find achievement. But when
Henry entered Italy in September, 1310, he soon found
he had reckoned without the Florentines, who had called
together the Guelf cities, and, leaguing themselves with
King Robert the Wise of Naples, formed what was, in fact,
an Italian confederation to defend freedom and their
common independence. It is true that in these acts
Florence thought only of present safety: she was both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
right and fortunate; but in allying herself with King
Robert and espousing the cause of France and the Pope
she contributed to that triumph which was to prove
for centuries the most dangerous of all to Italian liberty
and independence.</p>

<p>Bitter with loneliness, imprisoned in the adamant of his
personality, Dante, amid the rocks of the Casentino,
hurled his curses on Florence, and not on Florence alone.
Is there, I wonder, anything but hatred and abuse of the
cities of his Fatherland in all his work? He has judged
his country as God Himself will not judge it, and he
kept his anger for ever. In the astonishing and disgraceful
letters written in the spring of 1311 he urged
Henry to attack his native city. Hailing this German
king&mdash;and the Florentines would call him nothing else&mdash;as
the "Lamb of God Who taketh away the sins
of the world," he asks him: "What may it profit
thee to subdue Cremona? Brescia, Bergamo, and other
cities will continue to revolt until thou hast extirpated
the root of the evil. Art thou ignorant perhaps where
the rank fox lurketh in hiding? The beast drinketh
from the Arno, polluting the waters with its jaws. Knowest
thou not that Florence is its name?..." Henry, however,
took no heed as yet of that terrible voice crying
in the wilderness. He entered Rome before attacking
Florence, in May, 1312. He easily won the Capitol, but
was fiercely opposed by King Robert when he tried to
reach S. Peter's to win the imperial crown, and from Castel
S. Angelo he was repulsed with heavy loss. The Roman
people, however, presently took his part, and by threats
and violence compelled the bishops to crown him in the
Lateran on June 29.</p>

<p>If Rome greeted him, however, she was alone. Florence
remained the head and front of the unbroken League.
Those <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">scelestissimi Florentini</i>, as Dante calls them, still
refused to hail him as anything but Enemy, German King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
and Tyrant. The fine political sagacity of Florence, which
makes hers the only history worth reading among the
cities of Central Italy, was never shown to better advantage
or more fully justified in the event than when she
dared to send her greatest son into exile and to proclaim
his Emperor "German king" and "enemy." "Remember,"
she wrote to the people of Brescia, "that the
safety of all Italy and all the Guelfs depends on your
resistance. The Latins must always hold the Germans in
enmity, seeing that they are opposed in act and deed, in
manners and soul; not only is it impossible to serve, but
even to hold any intercourse with that race."</p>

<p>At last the Emperor decided to follow Dante's advice
and "slay the new Goliath." This was easier to talk of in the
Casentino than to do. From mid-September to the end of
October the Imperial army lay about the City of the Lily,
never daring to attack. Then the Emperor raised the
siege and set out for Poggibonsi, his health ruined by
anxiety and hardship, and his army, as was always the case
both before and since, broken and spoiled by the Italian
summer. He spent the winter and spring between
Poggibonsi and Pisa, then with some idea of retrieving all
by invading Naples, he set off southward in August to
meet his death on S. Bartholomew's Day, poisoned, as
some say, at Buonconvento.</p>

<p>And Florence announced to her allies: "Jesus Christ
hath procured the death of that most haughty tyrant
Henry, late Count of Luxemburg, whom the rebellious
persecutors of the Church and the treacherous foes
of ourselves and you call King of the Romans and
Emperor."</p>

<p>In the very year of Henry's death, as we suppose,
Boccaccio was born in Paris. The Middle Age had come
to an end. The morning of the Renaissance had already
broken on the world.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">The</span> facts concerning the life and work of
Giovanni Boccaccio, though they have been
traversed over and over again by modern
students,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are still for the most part insecure
and doubtful; while certain questions, of chronology
especially, seem to be almost insoluble. To begin with,
we are uncertain of the place of his birth and of the
identity of his mother, of whom in his own person he
never speaks. And though it is true that he calls himself
"of Certaldo,"<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a small town at that time in the Florentine
<i>contado</i> where he had some property, and where indeed he
came at last to die, we have reason to believe that it was
not his birthplace. The opinion now most generally professed
by Italian scholars is that he was born in Paris of a
French mother; and, while we cannot assert this as a fact,
very strong evidence, both from within and from without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>his work, can be brought to support it. It will be best,
perhaps, to examine this evidence, whose corner-stone is
his assertion to Petrarch that he was born in 1313,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> as
briefly as possible.</p>

<p>The family of Boccaccio<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was originally from Certaldo
in Valdelsa,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> his father being the Florentine banker and
money-changer Boccaccio di Chellino da Certaldo, commonly
called Boccaccino.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> We know very little about
him, but we are always told that he was of very humble
condition. That he was of humble birth seems certain,
but his career, what we know of his career, would suggest
that he was in a position of considerable importance. We
know that in 1318 he was in business in Florence, the
name of his firm being <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Simon Jannis Orlandini, Cante et
Jacobus fratres et filii q. Ammannati et Boccaccinus Chelini
de Certaldo</span>. In the first half of 1324 he was among the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">aggiunti deputati</i> of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arte del Cambio</i> for the election
of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Consiglieri della Mercanzia</i>;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in 1326 he was himself
one of the five Consiglieri; in the latter part of 1327
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>he represented the Società de' Bardi in Naples, and was
very well known to King Robert;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> while in 1332 he was
one of the <i>Fattori</i> for the same <i>Società</i> in Paris, a post at
least equivalent to that of a director of a bank to-day.
These were positions of importance, and could not have
been held by a person of no account.</p>

<p>As a young man, in 1310, we know he was in business
in Paris, for on May 12 in that year fifty-four Knights
Templars were slaughtered there,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and this Boccaccio tells
us his father saw.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> That there was at that time a considerable
Florentine business in France in spite of those
years of disaster&mdash;Henry VII had just entered Italy&mdash;is
certain. In 1311, indeed, we find the Florentines addressing
a letter to the King of France,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> lamenting that at such a
moment His Majesty should have taken measures hurtful
to the interests of their merchants, upon whom the prosperity
of their city so largely depended.</p>

<p>Boccaccio di Chellino seems to have remained in Paris
in business;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that he was still there in 1313 we know, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>in that year, on March 11, Jacques de Molay, Master of
the Templars, was executed, and Giovanni tells us that his
father was present.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> If, then, Boccaccio was speaking the
truth when he told Petrarch he was born in 1313, he must
have been conceived, and was almost certainly born, in Paris.</p>

by Laurent le Premierfait. MS. late XV century. (Brit. Mus. Showcase V, MS. 126.)</i></div>
</div>

<p>Let us now examine such evidence as we may gather
from the allegories of his own poems and plays, though
there he speaks in parables. In two of his works at
least&mdash;the <cite>Filocolo</cite> and the <cite>Ameto</cite>&mdash;Boccaccio seems to be
speaking of himself in the characters of Idalagos<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and
Caleone and Ibrida. The <cite>Ameto</cite>, like the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, was
written to give expression to his love for Fiammetta,
the bastard daughter of King Robert of Naples. There
he says that Caleone (whom we suppose to be in some
sort himself) was born not far from the place whence
Fiammetta's mother (whom he has told us was French)
drew her origin. Again, in another part of the same
book the story is related of a young Italian merchant,
not distinguished by birth or gentle breeding, who went to
Paris and there seduced a young French widow. The
fruit of their intercourse was a boy, who received the
name of Ibrida. The evidence to be gathered from the
<cite>Filocolo</cite> is even more precise, but, briefly, it may be said
to confirm the story in the <cite>Ameto</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> We find there, however,
that the name of the father was Eucomos, which
may be bad Greek for Boccaccio; that the name of the
mother was Gannai, which might seem to be an anagram for
Giovanna or Gianna; and that the father deserted the
mother in order to marry Gharamita,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> which sounds like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>an anagram for Margherita, and in fact we find that
Boccaccio di Chellino did marry almost certainly about
1314 Margherita di Gian Donato de' Martoli.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The result then of these allegorical allusions in the
<cite>Ameto</cite> and the <cite>Filocolo</cite> is to support the theory based on
the few facts we possess, and to supplement it. That
theory absolutely depends, so far as we rely upon facts
for its confirmation, on Boccaccio's own statement, as
reported by Petrarch, that he was born in 1313. If he
was born in 1313, he was conceived and born in Paris, for
we know that Boccaccio di Chellino was there in the
years between 1310 and 1313. The <cite>Filocolo</cite> and the
<cite>Ameto</cite> bear this out, and lead us to believe that his
mother was a certain Gianna or Gannai (Jeanne, Giovanna),
that he was born out of wedlock, and that his father
deserted his mother, and not long after married Gharamita,
as we suppose Margherita di Gian Donato de' Martoli.</p>

<p>Turning now to the evidence of his contemporaries, we
shall find that just this was the opinion commonly received,
so much so that the Italian translator of Filippo
Villani's <cite>Lives</cite> actually changed the words of that author
and forced him to agree with it. "His father," says this
adapter,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> "was Boccaccio of Certaldo, a village of the
Florentine dominion. He was a man distinguished by
excellence of manners. The course of his commercial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>affairs brought him to Paris, where he resided for a
season, and being free and pleasant in the temper of his
mind, was no less gay and well inclined to love by the
complexion of his constitution. There then it befell
that he was inspired by love for a girl of Paris, belonging
to the class between nobility and bourgeoisie, for whom he
conceived the most violent passion; and, as the admirers
of Giovanni assert, she became his wife and afterwards
the mother of Giovanni."</p>

<p>As his admirers assert! But others were not slow to say
that his father and mother were never married; and
indeed, this without doubt was the ordinary opinion.</p>

<p>In the true version of Filippo Villani's <cite>Lives</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> written in
Latin, we read that he was the son of his natural father,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and that he was born at Certaldo. Domenico Aretino<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
agrees that Certaldo was his birthplace, and adds that in
his opinion Boccaccio was a bastard. Again, Salvini and
Manni, following perhaps the well-known sonnet of
Acquettino, say he was born in Florence.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In all this
confusion we are like to lose our way, and it is therefore
not surprising that modern scholars are divided in opinion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Tiraboschi<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> remains undecided. Baldelli<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> thinks he was
born in Paris and was illegitimate; Ginguené, Witte,
Carducci, Landau, Hortis, Antona Traversi, and Crescini
agree with Baldelli&mdash;and, indeed, we find only two modern
students who give Florence as his birthplace, to wit
Corazzini<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and Koerting<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, who agree, however, that he
was a bastard.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the weight of opinion is on the
side of the evidence, and that it certainly seems to have
been shown that Boccaccio was born out of wedlock in
Paris in 1313, and that his mother's name was Jeannette
or Jeanne<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>It is probable that Boccaccio was brought still a tiny
baby to Florence, but we cannot be sure of this, for though
his father seems to have returned in 1314,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and almost at
once to have married Margherita di Gian Donato de' Martoli,
it is not certain that Giovanni accompanied him. Indeed the
<cite>Filocolo</cite> seems to suggest that he did not.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> However that
may be, he was "in his first infancy" when he came to
Tuscany, as he tells us in the <cite>Ameto</cite>, "fanciullo, cercai i
regni Etrurii." The first river he saw was the Arno,
"mihi ante alios omnes ab ipsa infantia cognitus"; and
his boyhood was spent on that little hill described in the
<cite>Filocolo</cite>, "piccolo poggio pieno di marine chiocciole," and
covered with "salvatichi cerri," in the house of his father,
"nel suo grembo," as he says in the <cite>Fiammetta</cite>.</p>

<p>Where was this hill dark with oaks where one might
find sea-shells, the tiny shells of sea-snails? We do not
know for certain. Some have thought it to be the hill of
Certaldo,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> but this seems scarcely likely, for we know that
old Boccaccio was resident in Florence in 1318, and
Boccaccio himself tells us that his boyhood was spent not
in a house belonging to his father, but "nel suo grembo,"
literally in his father's lap.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Again, the country which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>loved best and has described with the greatest love and
enthusiasm is that between the village of Settignano and
the city of Fiesole, north and east of Florence. As though
unable to forget the lines of just those hills, the shadows
on the woods there, the darkness of the cypresses over the
olives, he returns to them again and again. The <cite>Ninfale
Fiesolano</cite> is entirely devoted to this country, its woods and
hills and streams; he speaks of it also in the <cite>Ameto</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> it is
the setting of the <cite>Decameron</cite>; while the country about
Certaldo does not seem to have specially appealed to him,
certainly not in the way the countryside of one's childhood
never ceases to do.</p>

<p>It is, then, to the hills about Settignano, to the woods
above the Mensola and the valley of the Affrico, that we
should naturally turn to look for the scenes of his boyhood.
And indeed any doubt of his presence there might seem to
be dismissed by a document discovered by Gherardi,
which proves that on the 18th of May, 1336, by a contract
drawn up by Ser Salvi di Dini, Messer Boccaccio di Chellino
da Certaldo, lately dwelling in the parish of S. Pier
Maggiore and then in that of S. Felicità, sold to Niccolò
di Vegna, who bought for Niccolò the son of Paolo his
nephew, the <i>poderi</i> with houses called Corbignano, partly
in the parish of S. Martino a Mensola and partly in that
of S. Maria a Settignano.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> This villa of old Boccaccio's
exists to-day at Corbignano, and bears his name, Casa di
Boccaccio, and though it has been rebuilt much remains
from his day&mdash;part of the old tower that has been broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>down and turned into a loggia, here a ruined fresco, there
a spoiled inscription.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Here, doubtless, within sound of
Mensola and Affrico, within sight of Florence and Fiesole,
"not too far from the city nor too near the gate," Giovanni's
childhood was passed.</p>

<p>Of those early years we have naturally very little knowledge.
Before he was seven years old, as he himself tells
us,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> he was set to learn to read and write. Then he was
placed in the care of Giovanni di Domenico Mazzuoli da
Strada, father of the more famous Zanobi, to begin the
study of "Grammatica."<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> With Mazzuoli he began Latin
then,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> but presently his father, who had already destined him
for the counting-house, took him from the study of "Grammatica"
and, as Giovanni tells us, made him give his time to
"Arismetrica."<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Then, if we may believe the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, he
took him into his business, where he learned, no doubt, to
keep books of account and saw some of the mysteries
of banking and money-lending. Against this mode of life
he conceived then a most lively hatred, which was to
increase rather than to diminish as he grew older. Such
work, he assures us in his <cite>Commentary</cite> on the <cite>Divine
Comedy</cite>, cannot be followed without sin. Great wealth,
he tells us in the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, prohibits, or at least spoils virtue:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>there is nothing better or more honest than to live in a
moderate poverty; while in the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Genealogiis Deorum</cite> he
says poverty means tranquillity of soul: for riches are
the enemy of quietness and a torment of the mind.</p>

<div class="caption">CASA DI BOCCACCIO, CORBIGNANO, NEAR FLORENCE</div>
</div>

<p>But we know nothing of his childhood, only it seems to
have been unhappy. Till his return from Naples many
year later, in spite of his hatred for business, he seems
always to have got on well with his father.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In remembering
words which he then wrote concerning him<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
we must remind ourselves that Boccaccino was at that
time an old man, and had probably lost those "excellent
manners" of which Villani speaks; and by then, too,
Giovanni had altogether disappointed him, by forsaking
first business, and later the study of Canon Law. His
childhood seems to have been unhappy then not from any
fault or want of care on his father's part, though no doubt
his hatred of business had something to do with it; but
the true cause of the unhappiness, and even, as he says, of
the fear which haunted his boyhood, was almost certainly
Margherita, his stepmother, with whom he doubtless
managed to live well enough till her son Francesco was
born.</p>

<p>We have already relied so much on the <cite>Filocolo</cite> and the
<cite>Ameto</cite> that it will only confuse us to forsake them now.
In the former,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> he tells us that one day the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>shepherd, Idalagos (himself), following his father, saw
two bears, who glared at him with fierce and terrible
eyes in which he saw a desire for his death, so that he
was afraid and fled away from the paternal fields to follow
his calling in other woods. These two bears who chased
Giovanni from home, not directly but indirectly, by causing
the fear which hatred always rouses in the young,
were, it seems, Margherita and her son Francesco, born
about 1321.</p>

<p>It may well be that Boccaccino had come to the conclusion
about this time that Giovanni would never make
a banker, and hoping yet to see him prosperous in the
Florentine manner, sent him to Naples to learn to be a
merchant. If we add to this inference the evidence of the
allegory of the two bears in the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, we may conclude
that his father, disappointed with him already, was not
hard to persuade when Margherita, loath to see the
little bastard beside her own son Francesco, urged his
departure.</p>

<p>All this, however, is conjecture. We know nothing of
Boccaccio's early years save that his father sent him to
Naples to learn business while he was still young, as is
generally believed in 1330, but as we may now think, not
without good reason, in 1323, when he was ten years
old.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<h2><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER II</a></h2>
<p class="pfs90">1323-1330</p>
<p class="negidt2 medium w-sp">HIS ARRIVAL IN NAPLES&mdash;HIS YEARS WITH THE
MERCHANT&mdash;HIS ABANDONMENT OF TRADE AND
ENTRY ON THE STUDY OF CANON LAW</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">In</span> the fourteenth century the journey from Florence
by way of Siena, Perugia, Rieti, Aquila, and Sulmona,
thence across the Apennines at Il Sangro, and so
through Isernia and Venafro, through Teano and
Capua to Naples, occupied some ten or eleven days.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
The way was difficult and tiring, especially for a lad of ten
years old, and it seems as though Giovanni was altogether
tired out, for, if we may believe the <cite>Ameto</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> as he drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>near the city at last he fell asleep on his horse. And as he
slept, a dream came to him. Full of fear as he was,
lonely and bewildered, those "two bears" still pursuing
him, doubtless, in his heart, suddenly it seemed to him
that he was already arrived in the city. "The new streets,"
he says in the <cite>Ameto</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> "held my heart with delight, and as
I passed on my way there appeared to the eyes of my
mind a most beautiful girl, in aspect gracious and fair,
dressed all in garments of green, which befitted her age
and recalled the ancient dress of the city; and with joy
she gave me welcome, first taking me by the hand, and she
kissed me and I her; and then she said sweetly, 'Come
where you shall find good luck and happiness.'"<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> It was
thus Giovanni was welcomed into Naples with a kiss.</p>

<p>Naples was then at the height of its splendour, under
Robert the Wise, King of Jerusalem and the Two Sicilies,
Count of Provence. If his titles had little reality, for that
of Jerusalem merely commemorated an episode of history,
and Sicily itself had passed into the hands of Aragon, as
King of Naples and Count of Provence he possessed an
exceptional influence in the affairs of Europe, while in
Italy he was in some sort at the head of the triumphant
Guelf cause. The son of Charles I of Anjou, King of
Naples, Duke Robert, had seized the crown of Italy and
Apulia, not without suspicion of fratricide; for the tale
goes that none knew better than he the cause of the sudden
illness which carried off his elder brother, Dante's beloved
Charles Martel. However that may be, in June, 1309,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Duke Robert went by sea from Naples to Provence to the
Papal Court there, "with a great fleet of galleys," Villani<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
tells us, "and a great company, and was crowned King of
Sicily and of Apulia by Pope Clement on S. Mary's Day
in September." A year later we find him in Florence on
his way back from Avignon. He stayed in the house
of the Peruzzi dal Parlagio, and Villani<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> says: "The Florentines
did him much honour and held jousts and gave him
large presents of money, and he abode in Florence until
the 24th day of October to reconcile the Guelfs together
... and to treat of warding off the Emperor." He was,
in fact, the great opponent, as we have seen, of Henry VII,
and in 1312 Villani<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> records that he sent 600 Catalan
and Apulian horse to Rome to defend the City, while
the people of Florence, Lucca, and Siena, and of other
cities of Tuscany who were in league with him, sent
help also; yet though they held half Rome between
them, Henry was crowned in the Lateran after all. It was
in the very year of the Emperor's death that the Florentines
gave him the lordship of their city, as did the Lucchese,
the Pistoians, and the men of Prato.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Later, after much
fighting, the Genoese did the same; so that in the year
1323 King Robert was in some sort drawing tribute from
more than half the Communes of Central Italy. The
brilliancy of his statecraft, or even, perhaps, of his statesmanship,
added to the splendour of Naples, whither his
magnanimity and the brilliance of his court attracted
some of the greatest men of the time.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p class="verse">Regem virtute refertum"</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">wrote Petrarch of him later&mdash;"full of virtue." While in a
letter written in 1340 to Cardinal Colonna he says that of
all men he would most readily have accepted King Robert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>as a judge of his ability. Nor were they poets and men
of learning alone whom he gathered about him. In 1330
Giotto, who had known Charles of Calabria in Florence
in 1328,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> came to Naples on his invitation; while so early
as 1310, certainly, Simone Martini was known to him, and
seems about that time to have painted his portrait, later
representing him in S. Chiara as crowned by his brother
S. Louis of Toulouse.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It was then into a city where
learning and the arts were the fashion that Boccaccio came
in 1323.</p>

<p>There were other things too: the amenity of one's days
passed so much in the open air, the splendour of a city
rich and secure, the capital of a kingdom, and the residence
of a king&mdash;the only king in Italy&mdash;above all, perhaps,
the gaiety of that southern life in the brilliant
sunshine. Boccaccio never tires of telling us about
this city of his youth. "Naples," he says in the
<cite>Fiammetta</cite>, "was gay, peaceful, rich, and splendid above
any other Italian city, full of festas, games, and shows."
"One only thought, how to occupy oneself," he says again,
"how to amuse oneself, dancing to the sound of music, discussing
affairs of love, and losing one's heart over sweet
words, and Venus there was indeed a goddess, so that
more than one who came thither a Lucrece returned a
Cleopatra. Sometimes," he continues, "the youths and
maidens went in the gayest companies into the woods,
where tables were prepared for them on which were set
out all manner of delicate meats; and the picnic over,
they would set themselves to dance and to romp and
play. Some would glide in boats along the shore, others,
dispensing with shoes and stockings, and lifting high
their petticoats, would venture among the rocks or into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>the water to find sea shells; others again would fish with
lines." And then there were the Courts of Love held in
the spring, when the girls, adorned with splendid jewels,
he tells us in the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, tried to outshine one another,
and while the old people looked on, the young men
danced with them, touching their delicate hands. And
seeing that he was surrounded by a life like this, is it
any wonder that he fell in love with love, with beauty?</p>

<div class="caption">KING ROBERT OF NAPLES CROWNED BY S. LOUIS OF TOULOUSE<br />

<i>From the fresco by Simone Martini in S. Lorenzo, Naples.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Of the first years of his sojourn in that beautiful southern
place we have only the vaguest hints.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
Genealogiis</cite><a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> he says that "for six years he did nothing
but waste irrecoverable time" with the merchant to whom
his father had confided him. He always hated business,
and precocious as he was in his love for literature, in the
gaiety and beauty of Naples he grew to despise those
engaged in money-making; for, as he says in the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>,
they knew nothing of any beautiful thing, but
only how to fill their pockets.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Indeed Boccaccio might
seem to have had no taste or even capacity for anything
but study and the art of literature. He most bitterly
reproaches his father in the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Genealogiis</cite><a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> for having
turned him for so many years from his vocation. "If my
father had dealt wisely with me I might have been among
the great poets," he writes. "But he forced me, in vain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>to give my mind to money-making, and to such a paying
thing as the Canon Law. I became neither a man of
affairs nor a canonist, and I lost all chance of succeeding
in poetry."</p>

<p>Those six irrecoverable years had indeed almost passed
away before even in Naples he was able to find, unlearned
as he was, "rozza mente" as he calls himself, any opportunity
of culture. It was in 1328,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> it seems, that those
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">conversazioni astronomiche</i> began with Calmeta, which
aroused in him the desire of wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> By that time his
father was in Naples, having come thither in the autumn
of 1327, and it may have been in his company that
Giovanni first met this the earliest friend of his youth.
But who was this Calmeta, this benefactor to whom, after
all, we owe so much? Andalò di Negro, says Crescini;<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
but as Della Torre reminds us, his work was done in
Latin, and Giovanni knew but little of the tongue. It
will be seen in the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, to which we must turn again
for guidance, that Calmeta and Idalagos have the same
profession; they are both shepherds, and it is in their
leisure that Calmeta teaches Idalagos astronomy. It
seems then that Calmeta was also in business in Naples.
That such an one there was Della Torre proves by drawing
attention to a letter he will not allow to be apocryphal.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Calmeta, then, as we see, like Giovanni, was inclined to
study, and more fortunate than he, had been able "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">tuam
puerilem ætatem coram educatoribus roborare, et vago
atque interno intuiti elementa grammaticæ ruminare</span>...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>that is to say, to finish his elementary course of study,
which consisted of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric.</p>

<p>But this new friendship was not the only thing that about
this time helped to strengthen Giovanni's dislike of business
and to encourage him in his love of learning and literature.
For in the same year, 1328, it seems likely that he was
presented at the court of King Robert,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> a court, as we
have already said, full of gay, delightful people and learned
men.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It seems certain too that he was presented by his
father who, as we have seen, between September and
November, 1327, came to Naples as a member of the
Società de' Bardi.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Now old Boccaccio not only went frequently
to court during his sojourn in Naples, for he was
very honourably received there, but was probably one of the
most considerable Florentine merchants in the city,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and
then he had known Carlo, Duke of Calabria, in Florence,
before setting out.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> There can therefore be very little
doubt as to where Giovanni got his introduction.</p>

<p>Before his father left Naples, Giovanni, who was then
about sixteen years of age, had had the courage to tell him
that he could not pursue a business career.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> His father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>seems at last to have been convinced of this, and gave his
consent for study in the Arts, but, practical man as he was,
he believed in a fixed profession, and therefore set Giovanni
in 1329<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> to study Canon Law, which might well bring him a
career. So his father left him.</p>

<p>Whatever his duties had been or were to be, neither they
nor his studies with his friend the young merchant occupied
all his time. He enjoyed life, entering with gusto into the
gaiety of what was certainly the gayest city in Italy then
and later. He speaks often of the beauty of the women<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
amid that splendour of earth and sky and sea; and the
beautiful names of two he courted and loved, being in love
with love, have come down to us, to wit Pampinea, that
white dove "bianca columba," and Abrotonia, the "nera
merla" of the <cite>Filocolo</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Like Romeo, Boccaccio had his
Rosaline. These were not profound passions, of course,
but the sentimental or sensual ardours of youth that were
nevertheless an introduction to love himself.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> They soon
passed away, though not without a momentary chagrin, for
if he betrayed the first, the second seems to have forsaken
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>After that disillusion he tells us he retired into his
room, and there, tired as he was, fell asleep half in tears.
And again, as once before, a vision came to him. He
seemed to be sitting, where indeed he was, all sorrowful,
when suddenly Abrotonia and Pampinea appeared to him.
For some time they watched him weeping, and then began
to make fun of his tears. He prayed them to leave him
alone since they were the first and only cause of his
grief, but the two damsels redoubled their laughter,
so that at last he turned to them and said: "Begone,
begone! Is your laughter then the price of my verses
in your honour and of all my trouble?"<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But they
answered that it was for another that he had really
sung. Then he awoke; it was still night, and, tearful
as he was, he rose to light the lamp, and sat thus thinking
for a time. But weary at last he returned to bed, and
presently falling asleep he dreamed again. Once more the
two girls stood before him, but with them was another,
fairer far, all dressed in green. Her they presented to him,
saying that it was she who would be the real "tyrant of
his heart." Then he looked at her, and behold, she was
the same lady he had seen in the first vision when, weary
with the long roads, he first drew near to Naples; the very
lady indeed who bade him welcome and kissed him, and
whom he kissed again. So the dream ended.</p>

<p>What are we to think of these visions? Did they really
happen, or are they merely an artistic method of stating
certain facts&mdash;among the rest that Fiammetta was about
to renew his life? But we have gone too far to turn
back now; we have already relied so much on the allegories
of the <cite>Ameto</cite>, the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, and the <cite>Fiammetta</cite>, that
we dare not at this point question them too curiously.
The visions are all probably true in substance if not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
detail. We must accept them, though not necessarily the
explanations that have been offered of them.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>All this probably happened at the end of 1329, and
Fiammetta was still more than a year away. By this time,
however, Boccaccio was already studying Canon Law.
Who was his master? He does not himself tell us. All
he says is in the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Genealogiis</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and many reading that
passage have at once thought of Cino da Pistoja, chiefly
perhaps because it is so delightful to link together two
famous men.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> But while it is true that Cino was a doctor of
Law in Naples in 1330,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> we know that Boccaccio studied
Canon Law, and that Cino was a Doctor of Civil Law and
a very bitter enemy of the <i>Canonisti</i>.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> It seems indeed
impossible to name his master.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Whoever he may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>been, the study of Canon Law which presently became so
repugnant to Giovanni must have been at first, at any rate,
much more delightful than business. It probably gave
him more liberty for reading and for pleasure. He had,
of course, begun to study Latin again, and no doubt he
read Ovid, whom he so especially loved&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">No doubt, too, he read the <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ars Amandi</cite>, "in which," he

who introduced to him the French Romances? Perhaps
it was one of the many friends he doubtless had among
the rich Florentine merchants and their sons then in
Naples;<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> but indeed he could hardly have failed to meet

Table we know,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> but he knew even better the legends of

<h2><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER III</a></h2>
<p class="pfs90">1331</p>
<p class="pfs90 w-sp">HIS MEETING WITH FIAMMETTA AND THE PERIODS
OF THEIR LOVE STORY</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">For</span> it was in the midst of this gay life, full of
poetry and study, that he met her who was so
much more beautiful than all the other "ninfe
Partenopee," and who seemed to him "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">quella
che in Cipri già fu adorata</span>," that is to say, Venus herself.
He saw her first on a Holy Saturday, on the Vigil of
Easter, as he himself tells us, and as we think on
30th March, 1331.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> He had gone to Mass, it seems, about
ten o'clock in the morning, the fashionable hour of the
day, rather to see the people than to attend the service,
in the church of S. Lorenzo of the Franciscans. And there
amid that great throng of all sorts and conditions of
men he first caught sight of the woman who was so
profoundly to influence his life and shape his work.</p>

<p>"I found myself," he says, "in a fine church of
Naples, named after him who endured to be offered as
a sacrifice upon the gridiron. And there, there was a
singing compact of sweetest melody. I was listening to
the Holy Mass celebrated by a priest, successor to him
who first girt himself humbly with the cord, exalting
poverty and adopting it. Now while I stood there, the
fourth hour of the day, according to my reckoning, having
already passed down the eastern sky, there appeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
my eyes the wondrous beauty of a young woman, come
thither to hear what I too heard attentively. I had no
sooner seen her than my heart began to throb so strongly
that I felt it in my slightest pulses; and not knowing
why nor yet perceiving what had happened, I began to
say, 'Ohimè, what is this?'... But at length, being unable
to sate myself with gazing, I said, 'O Love, most noble
Lord, whose strength not even the gods were able to
resist,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> I thank thee for setting happiness before my
eyes!'... I had no sooner said these words than the
flashing eyes of that lovely lady fixed themselves on
mine...."<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Fiammetta, for it was she, was tall and <i>slanciata</i>; her
hair, he tells us, "is so blonde that the world holds
nothing like it; it shades a white forehead of noble
width, beneath which are the curves of two black and
most slender eyebrows ... and under these two roguish
eyes ... cheeks of no other colour than milk." This
description, even in the hands of Boccaccio, is little more
than the immortal "Item, two lips, indifferent red...."<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
Yet little by little in his work Fiammetta lives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>for us. On that day she was dressed in a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bruna vesta</i>,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
and wearing a veil that fell from her head crowned with
a garland.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> After her golden hair, it is her eyes and her
mouth that he loves best in her.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verseq">"Due begli occhi luccan, sì che fiammetta</p>
<p class="verse">Parea ciascun d' amore luminosa;</p>
<p class="verse">E la sua bocca bella e piccioletta</p>
<p class="verse">Vermiglia rosa e fresca somigliava."<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He seems to have asked one of his companions who she
was, but he knew not.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verseq">"Io stetti molto a lei mirar sospeso</p>
<p class="verse">Per guardar s' io l' udissi nominare,</p>
<p class="verse">O ch' io 'l vedessi scritto breve o steso</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When she saw that he continued to stare at her, she
screened herself with her veil.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> But he changed his
position and found a place by a column whence he could
see her very well&mdash;"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">dirittissimamente opposto, ... appoggiato
ad una colonna marmorea</span>"&mdash;and there, while the
priest sang the Office, "con canto pieno di dolce
melodia,"<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> he drank in her blonde beauty which the dark
clothes made more splendid&mdash;the golden hair and the
milk-white skin, the shining eyes and the mouth like a
rose in a field of lilies.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Once she looked at him,&mdash;"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Li
occhi, con debita gravità elevati, in tra la moltitudine
de' circostanti giovani, con acuto ragguardamento
distesi</span>."<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> So he stayed where he was till the service was
over, "senza mutare luogo." Then he joined his companions,
waiting with them at the door to see the girls
pass out. And it was then, in the midst of other ladies,
that he saw her for the second time, watching her pass out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>of S. Lorenzo on her way home. When she was gone he
went back to his room with his friends, who remained
a short time with him. These, as soon as might be, excusing
himself, he sent away, and remained alone with his
thoughts.</p>

<p>The morrow was Easter Day, and again he went to
S. Lorenzo to see her only. And she was there indeed,
"di molto oro lucente"&mdash;"adorned with gems and dressed
in most fair green, beautiful both by nature and by art."<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
Then remembering all things, he said to himself: "This is
that lady who in my boyhood (<i>puerizia</i>) and again not so
long ago, appeared to me in my dreams; this is she who,
with a joyful countenance and gracious, welcomed me to
this city; this is she who was ordained to rule my mind,
and who was promised me for lady, in my dreams."<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
From this moment began for him "the new life."</p>

<p>Who was this lady "promised to him in his dreams,"
whose love was indeed the great prize of his youth? We
know really very little about her, though he speaks of her
so often, but in three well-known places, in the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, the
<cite>Ameto</cite>, and the <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Amorosa Visione</cite>, he tells us of her origin.
It is in the <cite>Ameto</cite> that he gives us the fullest account of
her. In that comedy<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> he tells us that at the court of King
Robert there was a gentleman of the wealthy and powerful
house of Aquino who held in Naples "the highest
place beside the throne of him who reigned there." This
noble had married, we learn, a young Provençal, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">per
bellezza da lodare molto</span>," who with her husband lived in
the royal palace.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Of this pair were born "some daughters
whom Fiammetta called sisters,"<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and a son who was
assassinated.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Fiammetta's own birth is, we understand,
surrounded by a kind of mystery, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">voluttuoso e lascivo</span>,"
corresponding, as we shall see, to her own temperament.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Boccaccio suggests that her birth is connected with the
great <i>festa</i> which celebrated the coronation of King Robert,
that took place in Avignon in September, 1309.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The
king returned to Naples by way of Florence, where he
arrived on September 30, 1310;<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> he was still there in
October, and there was much fighting to be done, for
Henry VII was making war in Italy; so that it was not
till February 2, 1313,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> that the king opened the first
general parliament in Naples after his coronation. Della
Torre<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> thinks that it was on this occasion the great <i>festa</i>
described by Boccaccio took place. Its chief feature
seems to have been a banquet of the greatest magnificence,
to which all the court as well as many of the
leading subjects of the Kingdom were bidden. Amid all
this splendour Boccaccio describes the king's gaze passing
over a host of beautiful women, to rest, always with new
delight, on the beauty of the young wife of D'Aquino,
who, since her husband belonged to the court, was
naturally present. Well, to make a long story short, a
little later the king seduced this lady, but as it seems, on
or about the same night she slept also with her husband,
so that when nine months later a daughter was born
to her, both the king and her husband believed themselves
to be the father. It is like a story out of the
<cite>Decameron</cite>.</p>

<p>This daughter, the Fiammetta of his dreams, was born,
he tells us, in the spring<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>&mdash;the spring then of 1314<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>&mdash;and
was named Maria.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Before very long she lost her
mother, who however, before she died, told her as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>she could, considering her tender age, the mystery of her
birth. Not long after, her father&mdash;or rather her mother's
husband&mdash;died also, leaving the <i>piccoletta</i> "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">a vestali
vergini a lui di sangue congiunte ... acciocchè quelle di
costumi e d' arte inviolata servandomi, ornassero la giovanezza
mia</span>";<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> which is Boccaccio's way of saying that
she was placed in the care of nuns, the nuns, as Casetti<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
supposes, of the Order of St. Benedict, to whom belonged
the very ancient church of S. Arcangelo a Baiano.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
There she grew up, and, like very many others of an
eager and sensuous temperament, totally unfitted for the
life of a religious, she desired too to be a nun, and this
desire, we learn, became definite in her after an ecstatic
vision in which S. Scholastica appeared to her<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and invited
her to take the vow. But happily this was not to be.
Her golden hair was not to fall under the shears of the
Church, but to be a poet's crown. She was too beautiful
for the cloister, and indeed already the fame of her beauty
had gone beyond the convent walls, which were in fact by
no means very secure or unassailable. In those days,
people "in the world," men as well as women, were received
even by the "enclosed" in the parlour of the convent,
where it was customary to hold receptions.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>So, we learn, there presently began a struggle in Fiammetta's
heart&mdash;it was not of very long duration&mdash;between
her resolution to take the veil and her feminine vanity.
Little by little she began to adorn herself,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> she received
offers of marriage which by no means shocked her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>she became reconciled to the life of the world for
which she was so perfectly fitted by nature. Among
the suitors, and apparently they were many, was "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">uno
dei più nobili giovani ... di fortuna grazioso, de'
beni Giunonichi copioso, e chiaro di sangue</span>."<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> To him,
as to the rest, she replied with a refusal, to which she
was doubtless encouraged by the nuns, who could not
easily suffer so well-born and powerful a pupil to escape
them. The young man, however&mdash;we do not know his
name&mdash;was not easily discouraged, and, renewing his suit,
was accepted. So she was married perhaps when she was
about fifteen years old, in 1329.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Her beauty<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> was famous, and she seems scarcely to
have been married when she gave herself up to all the
voluptuousness of her nature, more or less mute in the
convent. That she could read we know, for she read not
only Giovanni's letters, but Ovid,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> probably a translation
of the <cite>Ars Amandi</cite>, and the French Romances.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> She was
greatly run after by the youth of the Neapolitan court,
who swore no <i>festa</i> was complete without her. Her husband's
house, too, was in such a position that not only the
citizens, but strangers, who must on arrival or departure
pass it by, might spy her at her window or on her balcony.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
Her excuse is this universal admiration, and the eagerness
of her temperament, which allowed her to pass with ease
from one lover to another.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> And then she also found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>that stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is
pleasant.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> She excuses herself for having betrayed the
husband who loved her so much, and can say: "What is
lawfully pursued is apt to be considered of small account,
even though it be most excellent, but what is difficult of
attainment, even if contemptible, is held in high esteem."<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
But, like all vain and sensual natures, she was cruel, and
encouraged her suitors to squander their substance on
her, giving them nothing in return, and leading each to
suppose that he was the only one she loved, and that she
was about to make him happy. "And I," she says to
Boccaccio in the character of Alleiram, "and I have
laughed at them all, choosing, however, those who took my
fancy and who were judged apt to give me pleasure. But
no sooner was the fire spent than I broke the vase which
contained the water and flung away the pieces." These
words, so cynically moving, not only show us the cruelty
of Maria's nature, but cast a strange light on the general
condition of society in what was then, as later, the most
corrupt city in Italy. Such, then, was the blonde
Fiammetta whom Boccaccio loved.</p>

<p>But how could he, a mere merchant's son, ever hope to
reach the arms of this disdainful, indifferent lady? By
means of poetry? It seems so. But before replying fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>to this question it will be necessary to establish the
chronological limits and divisions of this love affair, and
this is the most difficult question in all the difficult history
of the youth of Boccaccio.</p>

<p>We may find, as it happens, two dates to begin with in
the <cite>Amorosa Visione</cite>. They have not escaped Crescini,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
who, founding himself on them, has concluded, though not
too certainly, that between the day of <i>innamoramento</i> and
that of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">possesso completo</i> 159 days passed. He arrives at
this tentative conclusion in the following manner. In
chapter xliv. of the <cite>Amorosa Visione</cite> Boccaccio tells us
that when he became enamoured of Fiammetta, at first he
marvelled greatly, as though something incredible had
befallen him. Then he began to make fun of himself,
"farsi beffa," for having thought of a lady so far above
him. But at last, when</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verseq">"Quattro via sei volte il sole</p>
<p class="verse">Con l' orizzonte il ciel congiunto aveva ..."</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">it appeared that his courting pleased his lady, and he
seemed to understand from her that there was no distance
however great, between lover and beloved, that love could
not annihilate. But, said she, one ought to serve her only,
and not to run after other ladies.</p>

<p>Crescini interprets this to mean that twenty-four days
after Boccaccio first saw Fiammetta, she gave him reason
to hope. And he arrives at this conclusion because he
considers that the sun is in conjunction with the horizon
only once a day, whereas it might seem to be so twice a
day, at sunrise as at sunset. The other 135 days of
Crescini's chronology come from the following verses of
chapter xlvi. of the <cite>Amorosa Visione</cite>, in which Boccaccio
tells us that he was able to possess Maria after</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verseq">"Cinque fiate tre via nove giorni</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Thus, says Crescini, we have twenty-four days from the
first meeting to the acceptance of his court, and 135 days
thenceforward to the possession, that is 159 days.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Della Torre,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> however, will have none of this reckoning,
and seems to have proved that it is indeed inexact. To
begin with, according to the Ptolemaic system, the sun
moved round the earth and touched it as it were not only
at its rising but also at its setting, so that the twenty-four
days become twelve. This, however, is but a small matter,
merely reducing the 159 days to 147. Crescini's chief
error, according to Della Torre, is that he has added the
first period of twelve (or twenty-four) days to the second
of 135&mdash;making them immediately consecutive. Let us
examine this matter somewhat closely.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Ameto</cite> Boccaccio tells us that the happy night
which came at the end of the 135 days, the night in which
he possessed Fiammetta, fell "temperante Apollo i veleni
freddi di Scorpione." Now at what time precisely is the
sun in the sign of the Scorpion? Andalò<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> tells us that
at the end of the 20th October the sun is three and a
half <i>gradi</i> in Scorpio, and that by the 15th November it is
already entering Sagittarius. The sun then entered Scorpio
on the 17th October and left it on the 14th November.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
Somewhere between those two dates the loves of Giovanni
and Fiammetta were consummated.</p>

<p>Boccaccio tells us, if we interpret him aright, that twelve

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Taken thus we may divide the story of his love for Fiammetta
into three periods. The first of these ends twelve
days after the first meeting, and is the period of uncertainty.
The second period is that in which he is accepted as courtier,
as it were, on his trial. The third begins when his lady,
moved by long service and repeated proofs of his devotions,
returns his love; it is the period of "dolce signoria" and
lasts one hundred and thirty-five days, at the end of which
she gives herself to him.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Of these periods we know only the length, then, of the
first and the last. The first began on the 30th March and
lasted till the 12th April, 1331, when the second began, to
last how long? Well, at least two months, it seems,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>three. In that case all three periods belong to the
same year. If this be not so, the second period was of
longer duration than three months, perhaps much longer.
Boccaccio himself tells us that it was "non senza molto
affanno lunga stagione."<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Now it seems reasonable to
suppose that even so eager a lover as Boccaccio cannot
call three months "lunga stagione," though he were dying
for her and each minute was an eternity. He can scarcely
have hoped to seduce a woman of his own class in less
time. Common sense, then, is on our side when reminding
ourselves that Maria d'Aquino was of the noblest
family, married, too, to a husband who loved her, and
generally courted by all the golden youth of Naples&mdash;while
Giovanni was the son of a merchant&mdash;we insist that
he cannot mean a paltry three months when he speaks of
a long time.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> But if the second period lasted more than
three months, and so does not belong to the year 1331, to
what year or years does it belong?</p>

<p>Della Torre seems to have found a clue in the following
sonnet, whose authenticity, though doubted by Crescini,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
he insists upon:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which we may explain as "O my lady, I shall be the
happiest of mortals if in the five years that I shall pay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>you court, I should break through your indifference...."
Five years brings us from 30th March, 1331, to 1336.</p>

<p>Now let us see whither the other facts we have will
lead us.</p>

<p>In 1339 Boccaccio and Fiammetta had parted,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Boccaccio
having been "betrayed" by her, as he tells us in
Sonnets iv. and xxxiii.,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> during the bathing season at Baia&mdash;the
bathing season then of 1338&mdash;whither she had forbidden
him to accompany her. But we know from Sonnets
xlvii. and xlviii. that the end of the second period
and the beginning of the third took place during the
bathing season, and that there was also a season in which
he accompanied her to Baia as her acknowledged lover.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
There must, then, have been three seasons before April,
1339, and these three years lead us again to the year
1336.</p>

<p>So we believe that the first period "of uncertainty"
in his love began on 30th March and ended on 12th
April, 1331; that the second period "of service" began
on 12th April, 1331, and ended between 3rd June and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>2nd July, 1336, when the third period began, ending
three years later. This third period is divided, as we have
seen, into three parts, and comprises three bathing seasons.
The first of these falls between 3rd June&mdash;2nd July, 1336,
and the 17th October to 15th November, i.e. 135 days; an
act of audacity on Giovanni's part, as we shall see, giving
him possession of Fiammetta. The second is a period in
which their love had become calmer: it fills the season of
1337 in which he was her <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cavaliere servente</i>. The third
falls in 1338, when, probably on account of the suspicions
aroused by their intimacy, Fiammetta forbade him to
accompany her to Baia, where in his absence she "betrayed" him.</p>

<p>Having thus found a chronology of Boccaccio's love-story,
we must consider more particularly his life during
its three periods.</p>

<p class="pfs90 w-sp">THE YEARS OF COURTSHIP&mdash;THE REWARD&mdash;THE
BETRAYAL&mdash;THE RETURN TO FLORENCE</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">Of</span> the first period of Giovanni's love-story, the
period of uncertainty which lasted but twelve
days, we know almost nothing, save that he
was used to remind himself very often of his
unworthiness, and to tell himself that he was only the son
of a merchant, while Fiammetta, it was said, was the
daughter of a king, and at any rate belonged to one of
the richest and most powerful families in the Kingdom.
That she was married does not seem to have distressed
him or appeared as an obstacle at all, for the court was
corrupt;<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> but he seems to have been disturbed by the
knowledge that she was surrounded by a hundred adorers
richer, nobler, and with better opportunities than himself.
And so he seems to have come to the conclusion that
there was nothing to be done but to make fun of himself
for having entertained a thought of her. It was apparently
in these states of mind that he passed the days
from Holy Saturday to 12th April, 1331, when he found
suddenly to his surprise that she was content he should
love her if he would.</p>

<p>What happened is described in the forty-fourth chapter
of the <cite>Amorosa Visione</cite>. The twelve days were passed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
he tells us in this allegory, when he heard a voice like
a terrible thunder cry to him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verseq">"O tu ... che nel chiaro giorno</p>
<p class="verse">Del dolce lume della luce mia,</p>
<p class="verse">Che a te vago sì raggia d' intorno,</p>
<p class="verse">Non ischernir con gabbo mia balìa</p>
<p class="verse">Nè dubitar però per mia grandezza,</p>
<p class="verse">La quale umil, quando vorrai, ti fia,</p>

<p class="verse">Nè d' alcun' altra più non ti curare,</p>
<p class="verse">Se tu non vo' provar mia rigidezza."</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>How can we interpret this? It seems that there was
evidently an occasion in which Fiammetta gave him to
understand that she was not averse from his love. What
was this occasion? Della Torre<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>&mdash;certainly the most
subtle and curious of his interpreters&mdash;thinks he has found
it: that he can identify it with that in which Fiammetta
bade him write the <cite>Filocolo</cite>.</p>

<i>By the Dutch engraver called "The Master of the Subjects in the Boccaccio."

</div>

<p>In the prologue to that romance Boccaccio tells us that
after leaving the temple of S. Lorenzo with full heart,
and having sighed many days, he found himself by chance&mdash;he
does not remember how&mdash;with some companions "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">in un
santo tempio del Principe de' celestiali uccelli nominato</span>":
that is to say, as Casetti interprets it, in the convent of
S. Arcangelo a Baiano, where Fiammetta had been. I have
said that it was quite usual for nuns to receive visitors,
both men and women, from the outside; the <cite>Fiammetta</cite><a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
itself confirms it if need be. The convents were in some
sort fashionable resorts where one went to spend an hour
in talk. On some such occasion Boccaccio went to
S. Arcangelo with a friend, and finding Fiammetta there,
probably told her stories from the French romances "del
valoroso giovane Florio figliuolo di Felice grandissimo Re
di Spagna," or of Lancelot and Guinivere, "con amorose
parole," stuffed with piteous words. When he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>finished, she, altogether charmed, turned to the young
poet and bade him write such a romance as that&mdash;for her&mdash;"a
little book in which the beginning of love, the courtship,
and the fortune of the two lovers even to their
death shall be told." Well, what could he do but obey
gladly? "Hearing the sweetness of the words which
came from that gracious mouth," he tells us, "and remembering
that never once till this day had that noble
lady asked anything of me, I took her prayer for a command,
and saw therein hope for my desires";<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> so he
answered that he would do his best to please her. She
thanked him, and Boccaccio, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">costretto più da ragione
che da volontà</span>," went home and began at once to compose
his romance.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> So ends the first period of his love-story,
and the second, the period of courtship, begins.</p>

<p>The first result of this interview and of the hope and
fear it gave him&mdash;for whatever may have been the case
with Fiammetta now and later, Giovanni was genuinely in
love&mdash;was that he wandered away "dall' usato cammino"
from the highway that had brought him so far and
abandoned "le imprese cose," things already begun.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>And if we ask ourselves what was this highway, we may
answer his way of life; and the things already begun&mdash;his
study of the Canon Law. About this time, then, he
began to go more to court, to enter eagerly into the
joy of Neapolitan life in search of Fiammetta. At the
same time his studies suffered&mdash;he neglected them to
the dismay, as we shall see, not only of his father, but
of his friends.</p>

<p>Something has already been said of the life at the
court of King Robert. The very soul of it was the three
ladies: Agnes de Perigord, wife of Jean D'Anjou, brother
of King Robert; Marie de Valois, wife of Charles, Duke
of Calabria, son of the king; and Catherine de Courteney,
who at twelve years of age had married Philip of Taranto,
another of the King's brothers.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The luxury in the city
was by far the greatest to be found in Italy. The
merchants of Florence, Lucca, Venice, and Genoa furnished
to the court <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">"scarlatti di Gant," "sciamiti, panni
ricamati ad uso orientale," "oggetti d' oro ed argento,"</span> and
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">gemmas et lapides pretiosas ad camere regie usum</span>."
Boccaccio himself describes Naples: "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Città, oltre a tutte
l' altre italiche, di lietissime feste abbondevole, non solamente
rallegra i suoi cittadini o con le nozze o con li
bagni o con li marini liti, ma, copiosa di molti giuochi,
sovente or con uno, or con un altro letifica la sua gente:
ma tra l' altre cose, nelle quali essa appare splendidissima,
è nel sovente armeggiare</span>."<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Or again of the spring there:
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">I giovani, quando sopra i correnti cavalli con le fiere armi
giostravano, e quando circondati da' sonanti sonagli
armeggiavano, quando con ammaestrata mano lieti mostravano
come gli arditi cavalli con ispumante freno si debbano
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>reggere. Le giovani donne di queste cose vaghe,
inghirlandate di nuove frondi, lieti sguardi porgevano ai
loro amanti, ora dall' alte finestre ed ora dalle basse porte;
e quale con nuovo dono, e quale con sembiante, e quale con
parole confortava il suo del suo amore</span>."<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>If he thus spent his time in play and love there can
have been little enough left, when the <cite>Filocolo</cite> was laid
aside, for study. We find his father complaining of his
slackness. Old Boccaccio had already been grievously
disappointed when Giovanni abandoned trade, and now
that he threw up or was not eager to pursue his law
studies, he was both distressed and angry; nor were
Giovanni's friends more content. All the Florentines at
Naples, he tells us, seemed to speak with his father's
voice. It was well to be in love, they told him, even
better to write poetry, but to ruin oneself for love, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monna
mia!</i> what madness, and then poetry never made any one
rich.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>So spoke and thought the practical Tuscan soul, and
the English have but echoed it for centuries. However,
Giovanni only immersed himself more in Ovid, and doubtless
the throb of hexameter and pentameter silenced the
prose of the merchants. Later, about 1334, he began to
read Petrarch;<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> their personal friendship, however, did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>not begin till much later, in 1350.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> His reading then, like
his love, inspired him to write verses, and as he tells
us, when the days of uncertainty were over, "Under the
new lordship of love I desired to know what power
splendid words had to move human hearts."<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> And
these <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ornate parole</i> were all in honour of his love. How
he praises her!</p>

<p>Presumptuous or no, he tells us very eloquently and

<p class="noindent">But he speaks of her beauty in a thousand verses in a

<p>He managed to see her, however, sometimes in church,
or at her window, or in the gardens, and once he followed
her to Baia, but only to see her "a long way off." Yet,
as he reminds himself, he always had her, a vision in
his heart:&mdash;</p>

<p>Then there were moments of wild hope, till the indifference
of Fiammetta put it out; and he would resolve
to break the "love chains," but it was useless. He humiliated
himself, and at last came to despair. It was in some
such moment, during her absence, we may think, that
he began the <cite>Filostrato</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and at length finally abandoned
those studies which in some sort his love had killed.</p>

<p>In this feverish state of mind, of soul, sometimes hopeful,
sometimes in despair, Boccaccio passed the next five
years of his life, from the spring of 1331 to the spring of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>1336. It was during this time, in 1335<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> it seems, that
with his father's unwilling permission he discontinued the
law studies he had begun in 1329, but had for long
neglected, and gave himself up to literature, "without a
master," but not without a counsellor&mdash;his old companion
in the study of astronomy, Calmeta. Other friends, too,
were able to assist him, among them Giovanni Barrili,
the jurisconsult, a man of fine culture, later Seneschal of
King Robert for the kingdom of Provence,<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and Paolo da
Perugia, King Robert's learned librarian, elected to that
office in 1332. Him Boccaccio held in the highest veneration,
and no doubt Paolo was very useful to him.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>We know nothing of his first literary studies, but we
may be sure he continued to read Ovid, and now read or
re-read Virgil&mdash;these if only for the study of versification.
As for prose, it is possible that he now read the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>
of Apuleius, which he certainly knew and admired.
However that may be, his work at this time
cannot have been very severe or serious, for his mind was
full of uneasiness about Fiammetta, and this excitement
no doubt increased in the early summer of 1336, when she
grew "kinder," and deigned even to encourage him; he
met her "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con humil voce e con atti piacenti</span>."<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

</div>

<p>What was the real cause of this "kindness" it seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>impossible we should ever know. Perhaps at the moment
Fiammetta lacked a lover, though that is hard measure
for her. Some cause there must have been, for a woman
does not surely let a lover sigh for five years unheard, and
then for no reason at all suddenly requite him. Certainly
Giovanni had made many beautiful verses for her, but
when did that touch a woman's heart? Yet, be the cause
what it may, in the summer of 1336 she would suddenly
grow pale when he passed her by, and then as suddenly
turn her "starry eyes" on him languidly, voluptuously:&mdash;</p>

<p>All this seems to have come to pass at Baia, perhaps, as
Boccaccio seems himself to suggest, one day in the woods
of Monte Miseno whither they were gone with a gay
company holding festa there in the golden spring weather.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
And there were other days too: long delicious noons in the
woods, still evenings by the seashore, where, though not
alone, he might talk freely to her, by chance or strategy, or
in a low voice whisper his latest verses beating with her
heart. Giovanni, we may be sure, was no mean strategist;
he was capable of playing his part in the game of hide-and-seek
with the world.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> He seems eagerly to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>sought the friendship of her husband and of her relations
and Fiammetta herself tells us in the romance that bears
her name that filled "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">non solamente dello amoroso ardore,
ma ancora di cautela perfetta il vidi pieno; il che sommamente
mi fu a grado. Esso, con intera considerazione
vago di servare il mio onore e adempiere, quando i luoghi
e li tempi il concedessero, li suoi desii credo non senza
gravissima pena, usando molte arti, s' ingegnò d' aver la
familiarità di qualunque mi era parente, ed ultimamente
del mio marito: la quale non solamente ebbe, ma ancora
con tanta grazia la possedette, che a niuno niuna cosa era
a grado, se non tanto quanto con lui la comunicava</span>...."<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Well, the one hundred and thirty-five days had begun.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
There were difficulties still to be overcome, however, before
he won that for which, as he says, he had always begged.
Fiammetta, like a very woman, denied it him over and
over again, though very willingly she would have given
it to him. Expert as he had become in a woman's heart&mdash;in
this woman's heart at least&mdash;Giovanni guessed all
this and knew besides that she could not give him what
he desired unless he took it with a show at least of violence.
Such, even to-day, are Italian manners.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> He awaited the
opportunity. It seems to have come during the absence
of the husband in Capua.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Screwing his courage to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>sticking-point, he resolved to go to her chamber, and to
this end persuaded or bribed her maid to help him.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>It was in the early days of November probably, days so
pensive in that beautiful southern country, that it befell
even as he had planned. Led by the maid into Fiammetta's
chamber, he hid himself behind the curtains of the great
marital bed. Presently she came in with the maid, who
undressed her and put her to bed, and left her, half
laughing, half in tears. Again he waited, and when at
last, desperate with anxiety and hope, he dared to come
out of his hiding, she was sleeping as quietly as a child.
For a time he looked at her, then trembling and scarce
daring to breathe the while, he crept into the great bed
beside her, in verity as though he were her newly wedded
husband. Then softly he kissed her, sleeping still, and
drawing aside the curtain that hid the light,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> discovered
to his amorous eyes "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">il delicato petto, e con desiderosa
mano toccava le ritonde mammelle, bacciandola molte
volte</span>," and already held her in his arms when she
awakened. She opened her mouth to cry for help, he
closed it with kisses; she strove to get out of bed, but he
held her firm, bidding her have no fear. She was defeated,
of course, but that her yielding might not seem too easy
she reproached him<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> in a trembling voice&mdash;trembling with
fear and pleasure&mdash;for the violence with which he had
stolen what she had always denied him; adding that all
was quite useless as she did not wish it.</p>

<p>Then Giovanni, putting all to the proof, drew a dagger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>from his belt, and retiring to a corner of the bed, in a low
and distressed voice said&mdash;we find the words in the <cite>Ameto</cite>&mdash;"I
come not, O lady, to defile the chastity of thy bed,
but as an ardent lover to obtain relief for my burning
desires; thou alone canst assuage them, or tell me to
die: surely I will only leave thee satisfied or dead, not that
I seek to gratify my passion by violence or to compel any
to raise cruel hands against me; but if thou art deaf to
my entreaties with my dagger I shall pierce my heart."</p>

<p>To kill himself&mdash;there. O no, Giovanni! Certainly she
did not want that. What then? Well, not a dead man
in her room, at any rate, for all the world to talk about.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
Yes, she was paid in her own coin. She was conquered;
her silence gave consent. "O no, Giovanni!"</p>

<p>"Donna mia," he whispered, "I came thus because it
was pleasing to the gods...."<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>"Thou lovest me so?" she answered. "And when then,
and how, and why ... and why?" So he told her all
over again from the beginning, and she, yielding little by
little, seemed doubtful even yet. Then he asked again,
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Che farò O Donna? Passerà il freddo ferro il solecito
petto o lieto sarà dal tuo riscaldato</span>?" At this renewed
menace the poor lady, without more ado, reached for the
iron and flung it away. Then he, putting his arms about
her and kissing her furiously, whispered: "Lady, the gods,
my passion, and thy beauty, have wounded my soul, and
thus as was already told thee in dreams I shall for ever be
thine: I do not think I need implore thee to be mine, but
if necessary I pray thee now once for all...."</p>

<p>That night was but the first of a long series, as we may
suppose. "Oh," says Fiammetta, in the romance which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>bears her name, "how he loved my room and with what joy
it saw him arrive. He held it in greater reverence than
any church (temple). Ah me, what pleasant kisses! What
loving embraces! How many nights passed as though
they had been bright days in sweet converse without sleep!
How many delights, dear to every lover, have we enjoyed
there in those happy days."<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>So autumn passed into winter and the long nights grew
short, and all the world was at the spring; and for them
too it was the golden age&mdash;so long ago. Well, do we not
know how they spent their lives? It was ever Giovanni's
way to kiss and tell. Has he not spoken of the festas and
the jousts, and the rare encounters that in Naples greeted
Primavera?<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> We see him with Fiammetta at the Courts of
Love, in the deep shade of the gardens, in the joyful fields,<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
on the seashore at Baia,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and at the Bagno beside the lake
of Avernus,<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> while we may catch a glimpse of them too at
a wedding feast.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> So passed what proved to be the one
happy year of their love, and perhaps the happiest of
Giovanni's life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That year so full of wild joy soon passed away. With
the dawn of 1338 his troubles began. At first jealousy.
He found it waiting to torture him on returning from a
journey we know not whither,<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> in which he had encountered
dangers by flood and field; a winter journey then, doubtless.
He came home to find Fiammetta disdainful, angry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>even indifferent. All the annoyance of the road came back
to him threefold:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Whose fault was it? Perhaps there is not much need to

and Giovanni could never help looking at "altre donne."<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
As we have seen, Fiammetta was surrounded by admirers
who were not, be sure, more scrupulous than Boccaccio.
So that his suspicions were aroused, and he must have
found it difficult to obey her when she forbade him to
follow her to Baia in 1338. Perhaps he had compromised
her, and for that cause alone she had ceased to care for him&mdash;it
would perhaps be after her nature; but however it
may have been, it was no marvel that he was jealous,
angry, and afraid.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>And his fears prophesied truly&mdash;he was betrayed. He
did not know it when she first returned to Naples after the
summer was gone. She took care of that,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> but she gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>him excuses instead of kisses, which only roused his angry
jealousy the more. "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il geloso</span>," she told him, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ha l' animo
pieno d' infinite sollecitudini, alle quali nè speranza nè altro

forth. These hypocritical and eloquent commonplaces did
not soothe him, but rather increased his anxiety. We
must remember that though Giovanni would gad after
other beauties, he loved Fiammetta then and always. It is
not surprising, then, that his jealousy became a wild anger.
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Nel cuore mi s' accese un' ira sì ferocissima, che quasi con

<p>But fate was not content, as he himself says,<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> with this
single blow. Till now he had wanted for nothing; he had
had a home of his own, and had been able to go to court
when, and as, he would, and to enter fully into the life of
the gay city. Now suddenly poverty stared him in the face.
His father, from whom all that was stable and good in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>life hitherto had proceeded, was ruined.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> But even in his
fall he remembered his son, and though Giovanni was now
twenty-five years of age, he maintained him, at considerable
inconvenience doubtless, from 1st November, 1338, to
1st November, 1339, by buying for him the produce of a
<i>podere</i> near Capua, "i beni della chiesa di S. Lorenzo dell' Arcivescovato
di Capua," which cost him twenty-six
florins.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Della Torre thinks that the wretched youth was
compelled to visit the place (possibly this was his fateful
journey) and to deal with a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fattore di campagna</i> and the
wily <i>contadini</i> of whom Alberti has so much to tell us a
century later. With them he would have to take account
of the grain, the grapes, the olives, the swine, and so forth,
while trying to write romances and to save his love from
utter disaster.</p>

<p>As though the ills he suffered were not enough, it was
at this time he lost a friend and protector from whom he
expected very much. Niccolò Acciaiuoli, whom he had
known since 1331, left Naples on 10th October, 1338, and
two years later Boccaccio writes to him on his return from
the Morea: "Nicola, if any trust can be placed in the
miserable, I swear to you by my suffering soul that the
departure of Trojan Æneas was not a deeper sorrow to the
Carthaginian Dido than was yours to me: not without
reason, though you knew it not: nor did Penelope long
for the return of Ulysses more than I longed for
yours."<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>And then all his companions forsook him owing to his
change of fortune; one by one they fell away. He who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>consorted with nobles and loved a king's daughter was left
alone; not in his own dwelling, but outside the city now,
"sub Monte Falerno apud busta Maronis," as he dates his
letters: close then to the tomb of Virgil. Was it now, at
the lowest ebb of his fortunes, in all this tempest of ill, that
he turned to the verse of the Mantuan who has healed so
many wounds that the Church may not touch; and so,
dreaming beside his sepulchre at Posilippo, remembering
the wasted life, the irrecoverable years, made that vow
which posterity has so well remembered, sworn as it was
on Virgil's grave, to give himself to letters, to follow his
art for ever?</p>

<p>Henceforth his life belongs to literature. "Every cloud,"
says the proverb, "has a silver lining," and the miseries of
youth, though not the least bitter, differ, in this at least,
from those of old age, that one has time to profit by them.
So it was with Giovanni. The tempest which had destroyed
so much that he valued most highly was in some sort his
salvation. To love is good, they had told him, to write
verses even better; but to ruin oneself for love&mdash;&mdash;!
What madness! Yet it was just that he had done, and
like many others who have practised his art, he found in
ruin the highway of the world.</p>

<p>Driven by poverty outside the city, deprived alike of its
pleasures and the excitement and distractions of his love,
he had nothing left but his art, and for the first time in his
life he seems to have set himself to study and to practise
it with all his might. Deserted by his companions, he
reminded himself that he was a poet and that solitude
was his friend. He seems to have read much, studying in
the shadow of Virgil's tomb the works of that poet<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> and
the writings of the ever-delightful Apuleius, while in
the letter to Calmeta we find&mdash;and this is most interesting
in regard to his own work&mdash;that he was already reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the <i>Thebais</i> of Statius.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Helpers, too, of a sort he had,
among them Dionigi Roberti da Borgo Sansepolcro,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
who, as Della Torre thinks, made him write to Petrarch, a
thing Boccaccio no doubt had long wished, but hesitated,
to do. The first extant communication between them,
however, dates from 1349.</p>

<p>In the midst of this resurrection of energy in which, as
we learn, he had already grown calm enough to see <cite>Fiammetta</cite>
afar off without flinching and even with a sort of
pleasure, his father, widowed by the death of Margherita,
"full of years, deprived by death of his children," summoned
him home.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> When did Boccaccio obey this summons?
That he was in Naples in 1340 is proved by the
letter "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sacro famis et angelice viro</span>," dated "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">sub Monte
Falerno apud busta Maronis Virgilii, Julii Kal <span class="smcap">IIII.</span></span>," i.e.
28th June, and, as the contents show, of the year 1340.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
He was still there in October, for on 1st November the
renewal of the contract of the <i>podere</i> of S. Lorenzo fell
due, but by 11th January, 1341, we know him to have
been in Florence.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> He left Naples, then, between 1st
November, 1340, and 11th January, 1341,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and as the
journey took eleven days or so he must have set out in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>the end of the year. By so doing, as it happened, he just
missed seeing Petrarch, who, invited to his court by King
Robert, left Avignon on 16th February, 1341, in the company
of Azzo da Correggio, to reach Naples in March.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>So Giovanni came back into the delicate and strong
Florentine country, along the bad roads, through the short
days, the whole world lost in wind and rain, neither glad
nor sorry, but thoughtful, and, yes, homesick after all for
that ghost in his heart.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">I have</span> written at some length and in some detail
of the early years of Boccaccio and of the circumstances
attending his love for Fiammetta, because
they decided the rest of his life, and are in many
ways by far the most important in his whole career. But
the ten years which follow his return to Florence are even
more uncertain and obscure that those which preceded
them, while we are without any of those semi-biographical
allegories to help us. It will be necessary, therefore,
to deal with these years less personally, and to regard
them more strictly from the point of view of the work
they produced. And to begin with, let us consider
the work already begun before Boccaccio left Naples, or
at any rate worked on during the years 1341-4, which were
spent in and around Florence.</p>

<p>That his life was far from happy on his return from
Naples we know not only from the bitter and cruel verses
he has left us, in which he speaks of his home&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verseq">"Dove la cruda ed orribile vista</p>
<p class="verse">D' un vecchio freddo, ruvido ed avaro</p>
<p class="verse">Ogn' ora con affanno più m' attrista&mdash;&mdash;"<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>but also from the letters he sent to Niccolò Acciaiuoli,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> in
which he says: "I can write nothing here where I am in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>Florence, for if I should, I must write not in ink, but
in tears. My only hope is in you&mdash;you alone can change
my unhappy fate." That he was very poor we may be
certain, and though he was not compelled to work at
business, the abomination of his youth, no doubt he had
to listen to the regrets, and perhaps to the reproaches, of
an old man whom misfortune had soured. His father,
however, seems to have left him quite free to work as he
wished, satisfying himself with his mere presence and
company. And then the worst was soon over, for, by
what means we know not, by December, 1342, he was
able to buy a house in the parish of S. Ambrogio, and to
live in his own way.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>This period, then, materially so unfortunate, not for
Boccaccio alone, as we shall see, is nevertheless the most
fruitful of his existence. For it is in the five years which
follow his return from Naples that we may be sure he
was at work on the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, the <cite>Ameto</cite>, the <cite>Teseide</cite>, the
<cite>Amorosa Visione</cite>, the <cite>Filostrato</cite>, and wrote the <cite>Fiammetta</cite>
and the <cite>Ninfale Fiesolano</cite>, and somewhat in that sequence;
though save with regard to the <cite>Filocolo</cite> perhaps, we have no
notice or date or hint even of the order of their production,
either from himself or any of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>It was at this time, too, that he perfected himself in the
Latin tongue and read the classics, of which he shows he had
a marvellously close if uncritical knowledge. His state of
soul is visible in his work, which is so extraordinarily
personal. A single thought seems to fill his mind: he had
loved a princess, and had been loved in return; she had
forsaken him, but she remained, in spite of everything, the
lode-star of his life. He writes really of nothing else but
this. Full of her he sets himself to glorify her, and to
tell over and over again his own story.</p>

<div class="caption">THE MURDER OF THE EMPEROR AND EMPRESS<br />

<i>From a miniature in the French version of the "De Casibus Virorum," made in 1409
by Laurent le Premierfait. MS. late XV century. (Brit. Mus. Showcase V, MS. 126.)</i></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>It was the story of Florio and Biancofiore, popular
enough in Naples, that had charmed Fiammetta at first
hearing in the convent parlour at S. Arcangelo a Baiano,
and it is round this tale that the <cite>Filocolo</cite> is written.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> As
he tells us himself in the first page, this was the first book
he made to please her, and it was therefore probably
begun in the summer of 1331.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The work thus undertaken
seems to have grown on his hands, and can indeed
have been no light task: it is the longest of his works
after the <cite>Decameron</cite>, and the weakest of all. The book,
indeed, as we now have it, must have demanded years of
labour; as he himself exclaims: "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">O piccolo mio libretto a
me più anni stato graziosa fatica</span>";<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> and it is certain that
it was still unfinished when he returned to Florence, and
probable that it remained so for some years. The narrative
is complicated, and the relation very long drawn out
and even tiresome.</p>

<p>There live in Rome, we learn, Quinto Lelio Africano
and Giulia Tropazia his wife, who have been married for
five years, and yet, to their sorrow, have no children.
Lelio is descended from the conqueror of Carthage,
Scipio Africanus, and Giulia from the Julian stock. They
are both pious Christians and vow a pilgrimage to S.
James of Compostella if, in answer to the prayers of that
saint, God will vouchsafe them a child. Their prayers are
heard, and with a great company they set out on pilgrimage
to Spain in fulfilment of their vow.</p>

<p>Now this pilgrimage has especially infuriated the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>ancient enemy of mankind, here half Satan, half Pluto,
and he is resolved to hinder it. In the form of a knight
he appears before King Felice of Spain, who is descended
in direct line from Atlas, the bearer of the heavens, and
tells him how his faithful city of Marmorina has been
assailed by the Romans, how it was sacked and its inhabitants
put to the sword without mercy.</p>

<p>Much moved to anger by this tale, King Felice sets out
against the Romans, and meeting Lelio with his people on
pilgrimage, takes them for his enemies and attacks them.
The little Roman company defends itself with the courage
of despair, but ends by succumbing to overwhelming
force. All the Romans are killed on the field and their
women made prisoners; but not before the King understands
how maliciously he has been deceived by the devil,
and how the folk he has killed were but innocent pilgrims.
So he leads Giulia and Glorizia her friend to his wife in
Seville, where a great fête is given in his honour.</p>

<p>And as it happens Giulia and the Queen give birth in
the same day to a daughter and a son respectively, who
are given the names of Biancofiore and Florio. Giulia,
however, dies in child-bed, and her daughter Biancofiore
is educated by the Queen with her son Florio. The two
children learn to read in the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">santo libro d' Ovidio</span>," in
which Boccaccio tells us the poet shows, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">come i santi
fuochi di Venere si deano ne' freddi cuori con sollecitudine
accendere</span>." And this reading is not without its
effect; the two children fall in love, Love himself appearing
to them.</p>

<p>There follows what we might expect. The King is
angered at their love, and refuses to permit the union of
his son with an unknown Roman girl. He sends the
fifteen-year-old Florio to Montorio, ostensibly to study
philosophy, but really to forget Biancofiore. After the
parting, charmingly told, in which Florio calls on the gods
and heroes, and Biancofiore gives him a ring which will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
always tell him of her safety, he departs. The King,
however, profiting by his absence, plots against Biancofiore
with the assistance of Massamutino the seneschal.
At a sumptuous banquet given in the castle the girl
is accused of having tried to poison him. She is condemned
to the stake, and Massamutino is to execute the
sentence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Florio has been disquieted by the sudden
tarnishing of the ring. Suddenly Venus appears to him,
and bids him go to the assistance of his mistress. Armed
with arms terrestrial and celestial, accompanied by Mars,
Florio hastens to Marmorina. He frees Biancofiore, and
in a sort of duel conquers the seneschal, and having
obtained from him a confession of the conspiracy, proves
the innocence of Biancofiore and kills him. During all
this he is incognito. Then, without heeding her prayers, he
gives her once more into the care of the King and returns to
Montorio without declaring who he is. There he is tempted
to be false to his love by two girls who offer him every
sort of love and pleasure, and it is only with difficulty he
keeps his faith. He is then assaulted by jealousy, however,
for he knows that a young knight, Fileno by name,
altogether noble and valorous, is fallen in love with
Biancofiore. Florio resolves to kill him, but the youth
is advised in a dream of his danger and flies into
Tuscany, where, by reason of his continual weeping, he is
changed into a fountain near a temple.</p>

<p>The persecutions of Biancofiore, however, are not over.
King Felice, wishing to be rid of her, sells her one day to
some merchants, and these take her at length to Alexandria
in Egypt. Florio, returning, is told she is dead;
he tries to kill himself on her pretended tomb, but his
mother prevents him and tells him the truth. He resolves
to set out through the world in search of his love. Here
the first part of the story may be said to end.</p>

<p>The second part is concerned with Florio's adventures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
He travels unknown under the name of Filocolo,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> that is
to say Fatica d' Amore. With his companions he voyages
first towards Italy, and, blown by a tempest to Partenope
(Naples), meets there in a garden the beautiful Fiammetta
and her lover Galeone amid a joyful and numerous company,
each member of which recounts an amorous
adventure, and closes the narrative with a demand for
the solution of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Questione d' Amore</i> which arises out
of it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Biancofiore has been sold to the admiral of
the Sultan of Babylon in Alexandria, who makes a collection
of beauties for his lord. This treasure is kept well
guarded, but with every consideration, at the top of a lofty
and beautiful tower by Sadoc, a ferocious old Arab, who,
however, has two weaknesses&mdash;his love of money and his
love of chess. Florio allows him to win at a game of chess,
and at the same time bribes him generously. Having
thus won his good will he has himself carried to Biancofiore
in a great basket of flowers. She rewards him for all
his labour. The admiral, however, learns of this, and,
furious at the spoliation of his property, condemns both
Florio and his mistress to be burned alive. But when they
are at the stake, Venus makes their bodies invulnerable,
and inspires Florio's companions to heroic deeds. In
admiration of their courage, the admiral is reconciled
with them; and, in fact, when Florio, Filocolo till
now, declares who he is, he finds that the old admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
is his uncle. Then follows the marriage and the
marriage feast.</p>

<p>Here the book might well have ended; but Boccaccio
has by no means finished.</p>

<p>On the way back to Spain, Florio, Biancofiore and their
companions pass through Italy. In Naples they find
Galeone abandoned by Fiammetta. They visit the places
round about, the baths of Baia, the ancient sepulchre of
Misenum,<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Cuma, the Mare Morto and Pozzuoli. Florio
fishes in the bay and hunts in the woods. One day
following a stag, he shoots an arrow that not only wounds
the animal, but also strikes the root of a tall pine, and,
wonderful to relate, Florio and Biancofiore see blood
spring from the wounded tree and hear a mournful voice
cry out in pain. This being, changed into a tree, proves
to be Idalagos, who, questioned by Florio, tells him all
his history, the history, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> of Boccaccio
himself, for it is his own story he tells in the name of
Idalagos.</p>

<p>After these adventures Florio, with Biancofiore and his
companions, goes on to Rome, where, like a modern tourist,
he visits all the sights. In the Lateran he meets the monk
Ilario, who discourses on religion, dealing severely with
paganism, and recounting briefly the contents of the Old
and New Testaments. He speaks also of the history of
the Greeks and Romans, and at last converts Florio and
his companions to Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Then follows the reconciliation
with Biancofiore's relations and the return to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>Spain, where, Felice being dead, Florio inherits his kingdom,
and with Biancofiore lives happily ever after.</p>

<p>Such, in the most meagre outline, is the main story of
the <cite>Filocolo</cite>; but Boccaccio is not really concerned with it
in its integrity, and in the construction of it he does not
show himself to be the future composer of the <cite>Decameron</cite>.
He collects in haste, and without much discernment, all
sorts of episodes and adventures, and tells them, not without
some confusion, solely to serve his own ends, to express
himself and his love. Sometimes he copies the French
poems from which in part he had the story,<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> though probably
his real sources were tradition; sometimes he invents
his own story, as in the tale of Idalagos. But as a work
of art the <cite>Filocolo</cite> is now intolerable, and is, in fact, even
in Italy, quite unread. For when we have followed the
hero in detail from birth to the unspeakable happiness
which is the finality of all such creations, we know nothing
of his character. He is not a man, but a shadow; the
ghost of a ghost. And as it is with Florio, so it is with
Biancofiore: they are pure nothing. But, as it seems,
Boccaccio was too young and too eager to care about
anything but flattering Fiammetta and telling her he
loved her. The story, in so far as it is a story, is an
imitation of the endless medieval tales told by word of
mouth in the streets and piazzas up and down Italy. Yet
now and again, even in this wearying and complicated
desert of words, we may find hints of the author's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>attitude of mind towards the great things of the world,
while once certainly we find a prophecy not only of
a great artist, but of the <cite>Decameron</cite> itself.</p>

<i>This cut originally appears in the "Troy Book." (T. Bonhomme, Paris, 1484.) Unique copy at Dresden.

</div>

<p>In the course of the book Boccaccio makes all sorts of
excursions into mythology, and towards the end into religion.
If we examine these pages we find that for him the
gods of Greece once reigning in Olympus are now devils
and demons according to the transformation of the Middle
Age. The monk who converts Florio and teaches him
Christian doctrine speaks with the same faith of Saturn
and the Trojan war, while Mars and Venus are never
named without the epithet of <i>Santi</i>, and S. James of
Compostella is "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">il Dio che viene adorato in Galizia</span>."</p>

<p>In spite, however, of its faults of prolixity and preciosity,
the <cite>Filocolo</cite> has, as I have said, this much interest for us
to-day, that in the finest episode, that of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Questioni d' Amore</i>,
it prophesies the <cite>Decameron</cite>. In the course of
his search for Biancofiore, Florio, it will be remembered,
comes to Naples, where in a beautiful garden he finds
Fiammetta and her lover Galeone. There, amid a joyful
company, he assists at a festa given in his honour, where
thirteen questions are proposed by four ladies&mdash;Cara, Pola,
and Graziosa, and one dressed in <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bruni vestimenti</i>; and nine
gentlemen&mdash;Filocolo, Longanio, Menedon, Clonico, Galeone,
Feramonte, Duke of Montorio, Ascalione, Parmenione, and
Massalino.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> It is Fiammetta's task to resolve these questions.
Neither the tales nor the questions which rise out
of them are entirely new. For instance, Galeone asks:
"Whether a man for his own good ought to fall in love or
no?" Feramonte demands: "Whether a young man should
love a married woman, a maiden, or a widow?" It is not
indeed so much in the questions as in the stories and the
assembly we are interested, for they announce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
<cite>Decameron</cite>, the whole of which, as Bartoli<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> says, is contained
in the <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Questioni d' Amore</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>The first edition of the <cite>Filocolo</cite> was published in Venice
in 1472 by Gabriele di Piero, with a life of Boccaccio
written by Girolamo Squarciafico. A French translation
appeared in 1542 by Adrien Sevin. It was translated
again in 1554 by I. Vincent (Paris, 1554, Michel Fezandat).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <cite>Filocolo</cite> was written in prose. In his next venture<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
Boccaccio, who had no doubt already written many songs
for Fiammetta, attempted a story in verse. It is written
in <i>ottave</i>, and was begun during the earlier and brighter
period of his love.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> "You are gone suddenly to Samnium,"
he writes in the dedication to Fiammetta, "and
... I have sought in the old histories what personage I
might choose as messenger of my secret and unhappy
love, and I have found Troilus son of Priam, who loved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Criseyde. His miseries are my history. I have sung
them in light rhymes and in my own Tuscan, and so when
you read the lamentations of Troilus and his sorrow at the
departure of his love, you shall know my tears, my sighs,
my agonies, and if I vaunt the beauties and the charms
of Criseyde you will know that I dream of yours." Well,
the intention of the poem is just that. It is an expression
of his love. He is tremendously interested in what he has
suffered; he wishes her to know of it, he is eager to tell of
his experiences, his pains and joys. The picture is the
merest excuse, a means of self-expression. And yet in its
exquisite beauty of sentiment and verse it is one of the
loveliest of his works. The following is an outline of the
narrative.</p>

<p>During the siege of Troy, Calchas, priest of Apollo,
deserts to the Greek camp,<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> and leaves his daughter
Criseyde, the young and beautiful widow, in Troy.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Troilus
sees her there in the temple of Minerva,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> and falls in love.
By good luck he finds that Criseyde is a cousin of his
dear friend Pandarus, whom he immediately makes his
confidant,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> obtaining from him the promise that he will
help him.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Pandarus goes slowly and cautiously to work.
He first persuades Criseyde to let herself be seen by
Troilus,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> and when this does not satisfy his friend he
shows himself rich in resource. At his suggestion Troilus
writes to Criseyde and he bears the letter. He spares no
way of persuading her, who at first swearing "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">per la mia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>salute</span>" that she will never consent, consents and makes
Troilus happy.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Almost all the third Canto is devoted to a description
of the happiness of the two lovers.</p>

<p>In fact, Cassandra has already discovered that her
brother is in love with a lady of no birth, the daughter of
a wretched and vulgar priest. So Troilus decides to have
a last meeting with Criseyde before she goes, to contrive
with her what is to be done. At this meeting the lovers
swear eternal fidelity<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and Criseyde promises to return to
him in Troy in ten days' time. Then in that same day
Diomede delivers one prisoner and takes Criseyde back
with him to the Greek camp.</p>

<p>Now Troilus is alone with his sorrow. He visits all
the places that remind him of Criseyde, and this pilgrimage

<p>At last the ten days pass, and Criseyde ought to return to
Troy. Troilus awaits her at dawn at the gate of the city;
but in vain: she does not come. He consoles himself,
however, by thinking that perhaps she has forgotten to
count the days and will come to-morrow. But neither
does she come on the morrow. Thus he awaits her for a
whole week in vain at the gate of the city, till at last in
despair he resolves to take his own life.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Criseyde, from the day of her departure, has
passed the time much better than Troilus. For in truth
she has consoled herself with Diomede, who, after the first
four days, has easily made her forget the Trojan. She
does not wish, however, that Troilus should know she has
broken faith. She answers his letters and puts him off with
words and excuses.</p>

</div>

<p>This sort of deception, however, cannot last long.
Troilus grows more and more suspicious, till one day
Deiphebus having fought with Diomede, he brings into
Troy a clasp taken from the Greek which Troilus recognises
as the same he had given to Criseyde, and is persuaded
of her falsity.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> So he resolves to avenge himself
on Diomede. In every encounter he rushes headlong on

<p>Thus ends this simple work. In it we see an extraordinary
advance on the <cite>Filocolo</cite> and the <cite>Teseide</cite>, both of
which were possibly planned and begun before the <cite>Filostrato</cite>
and finished later, for there is a fine unity about the
last which suggests that it was begun and ended without
intervention. Certainly here Boccaccio has freed himself
from all the mythological nonsense of those works as well
as from the lay figures and ghosts of knights who take
antique names and follow impossible ways. Here are real
people of flesh and blood, and among them nothing is
finer than the study of Criseyde. She is as living as any
figure in the <cite>Decameron</cite> itself. We see her first as a widow
mourning for a husband she has altogether forgotten;
yet when Pandarus makes his first overtures, she pleads
her bereavement, while she reads with delight the letters
Troilus sends her, and is already contriving in her little head
how and when she shall meet him. She tries to make
Pandarus think she is doing everything out of pity, but in
her mind she has already decided to give everything to her
lover, although she writes him that she is "desirous to
please him so far as she may with safety to her honour
and chastity." Then, as soon as she has left Troy weeping,
and Diomede has revealed his love to her, she forgets
Troilus because the Greek "was tall and strong and
beautiful":&mdash;</p>

<p>This character, vain, false, and light, but absolutely
living and a very woman, is opposed to the loyal character
of Pandarus, and is doubtless subtly modelled without
too much exaggeration on that of Fiammetta. In direct
contrast to it is the character of Troilus, the most beautiful
in the poem: so eager, so ardent, so perfectly youth
itself. He knows no country, no religion, no filial affection,
but lives and sees only Criseyde. Every day he will
thrust himself into the thickest of the fight in search of
glory that he may lay it at her feet and win her praise.
It is love that has made him a hero, as it made Boccaccio
a poet: but both Criseyde and Fiammetta were women;
what should they care for that? Troilus is a real
creation, the first of those marvellous living figures who
later people the <cite>Decameron</cite>: the first and the most
charming, the most youthful, the most beautiful. But the
whole poem is marvellously original alike in its characters
and in its versification.</p>

<p>As for the story, Boccaccio, it seems, got it partly from
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text was 'Benôit'">Benoît</ins> de Sainte-More, whose <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roman de Troie</cite> had been
composed from the uncertainly dated works of "Dictys
Cretensis" and "Dares Phrygius," and partly from the
prose Latin <cite>Hystoria Troiana</cite> of Guido delle Colonne;
there is certainly nothing of the <cite>Iliad</cite> there. But the
<cite>Filostrato</cite> is really an original composition, owing little
or nothing to any previous work. If there be any imitations
to be found in it they are not of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roman de Troie</cite>
or of Guido delle Colonne, but of Dante:<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> the <cite>Divine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>Comedy</cite> even at this time having cast its shadow over
Boccaccio.</p>

<p>In the ninth and last book of the poem, which is not
indeed a part of it, but rather a sort of epilogue, he
dedicates his work to Fiammetta,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Alla donna gentil della mia mente,"</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and tells her that she may find there his own tears and
sighs because of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verseq">"De' suoi begli occhi i raggi chiari,</p>
<p class="verse">Mi si occultaron per la sua partenza</p>
<p class="verse">Che lieto sol vivea di lor presenza."</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>These words to some extent date the poem, which was
apparently finished before Fiammetta had betrayed him,
and it seems likely even that he had not as yet obtained
from her the favours he valued so highly and of which she
was so generous to so many. These are the reasons why
I have considered the <cite>Filostrato</cite> so early a work in spite
of its perfection.</p>

<p>The poem was published for the first time about 1480
by Luca Veneto in Venice; it was translated into French<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
by Louis de Beauveau, Seneschal d'Anjou, and as we shall
see, Chaucer drew from it his exquisite poem <cite>Troilus and
Criseyde</cite>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In turning now to the <cite>Teseide</cite> we come apparently to
the third work, in point of time, of Boccaccio's youth. In
the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, itself a labour of love, he has told us of his
first joy; in the <cite>Filostrato</cite> of his hopes, torments, doubts,
and waiting; in the <cite>Teseide</cite> we see the agonies of his
jealousy. It was written to some extent under the influence
of Virgil as we should suppose, since it was begun, as we
may think, in the shadow of his tomb when Boccaccio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
had left the city of Naples,<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and it proves indeed to
be written in twelve books, and to have precisely
the same number of lines as the <cite>Æneid</cite>, namely 9896;
it is therefore about twice as long as the <cite>Filostrato</cite>. It
is prefaced by a letter "To Fiammetta," in which he
tells us why he has written the poem, while "thinking of
past joy in present misery." The work professes to be
a story of ancient times, and to be concerned with
the love two brothers in arms, Palemon and Arcite,
bear Emilia; but this is merely an excuse. "It is to
please you," he tells Fiammetta, "that I have composed
this love story." Was it with some idea of winning back
her love by this stupendous manuscript? How charming
and how naive, how like Giovanni too; but how absurd
to dream of thus influencing Fiammetta. Did she ever
read these nine thousand odd verses? <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Che! che!</i></p>

<p>The story is meagrely as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the barbarous land of Scythia,<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> on the shores of the
Black Sea, dwelt the Amazons under Ippolyta, their
queen. Now certain Greeks cast up on that coast in a
tempest had been ill-treated there, and Theseus, Duke of
Athens, undertakes a war of vengeance against that kingdom,
and in spite of a valorous defence conquers it.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
His price of peace is absolute submission and the hand of
the Queen Ippolyta. And it was so, and many of the
Greeks too, longing for women after the campaign,
married also. And when Theseus had lived in peace
there with his wife Ippolyta for more than a year,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> scarce
thinking of Athens, his friend Peritoo appeared to him in
a dream urging his return. So he set out and came to
Athens with Ippolyta and her younger sister Emilia.</p>

<p>Scarcely is he come to Athens when he is urged by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>deputation of the Greek princesses to declare war on
Creon, who will not permit the burial rites to be performed
for those who fell in the war of succession.
Theseus conquers Thebes and Creon is killed, the bodies
of the Greek princes are solemnly burned and their ashes
conserved.</p>

<p>So far the introduction, in which Boccaccio has followed
tradition with an almost perfect faithfulness: now begins
his own work, to which these adventures of Theseus are
but the preface.</p>

<p>Two youths of the royal Theban stock, Palemon and
Arcite, have been made prisoners by Theseus and taken
to Athens. There they see from the window of their
prison the beautiful Emilia of the blonde hair, sister of
the Amazonian queen. She is walking in the garden
when they see her and she them. She quickly finds that
she likes to be admired, and in all innocence coquets with
the two young prisoners,<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> who for six months lament their
love without hope.</p>

<p>Now as it happens, by the help of Peritoo, Arcite is set
at liberty, on condition that he goes into exile and only
returns to Athens under pain of death. Profoundly
sorrowful to leave Emilia, he sets out in company with
some esquires as a knight-errant, and wanders all over
Greece, until at last his love compels him to return to
Athens.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Once more in Athens, he enters the service of
Theseus, undiscovered and unknown, but that the little
Emilia recognises him, though she does not betray him.
He is, however, discovered and betrayed by his own imprudence.
For he arouses the jealousy of Palemon, who
escapes from his prison, and finding his friend and rival in
a wood, forces him to fight in order to decide who shall
have Emilia.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>While they were calling on Mars, Venus, and Emilia,<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> in
the same way as the Christian knights called on Madonna
and their lady, suddenly Emilia, who was hunting in that

presence, start in earnest.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> But at last Theseus arrives
called by Emilia, to end the combat and learn the cause
of the quarrel. Hearing it he pardons them, for he himself
has been young and has loved too, but he attaches to
his pardon a condition, to wit, that each of them, aided by
a hundred knights, shall combat in public for Emilia's
hand.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>The young lovers must send into all lands messengers
to enrol two hundred knights,<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> and these at last are
gathered together in the place of combat. Among the
rest came Peleus, still a youth, the great twin brethren
Castor and Pollux, Agamemnon and Paris, Narcissus,
Nestor, Ulysses, Pygmalion, prince of Tyre, Sichæus,
Minos, and Rhadamanthus, who have abandoned their
judgment seats in Orcus to witness the fight. Indeed, as
Landau has well said, if Homer had been there, he would
certainly have been delighted to find again so many he
had known of old, but he would also have marvelled to
find among them so many <i>jongleurs</i>.</p>

<p>Before beginning the struggle Theseus, Palemon, and
Arcite hold long discourses; the two rivals and Emilia
recite long prayers.</p>

<p>The prayer of Arcite is to Mars, who lives in the mists
of Thrace amid snow and ice. There in a thick wood of
stout oaks stands his palace of iron with gates of diamond,
at which mount guard Mad Fury, Murder, and
Eternal Anger red as fire.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Palemon's prayer is to Venus, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>lives in a garden full of fountains and streams and singing
birds. There meet Grace, Courtesy, Delight, Beauty,
Youth, and Mad Ardour. At the entrance sits Madonna
<i>Pace</i> (Peace), and near her Patience and Cunning in Love.
Within, however, Jealousy tortures his victims; while the
door which leads to the sanctuary where Venus reposes
between Bacchus and Ceres is guarded by Riches.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>The tourney is then described in the usual way, and
ends in the defeat of Palemon. However, as Arcite only
asked Mars for victory, he cannot enjoy it or its fruit.
Palemon, it seems, asked not for victory, but that he
might have Emilia. So the gods decide it. And therefore

<p>What are we to make of such a work as this? Ambitious
and complicated though it be, it is out of all
comparison feebler than the simple tale of Troilus and
Criseyde. Nor has it the gift of life, nor the subtle
characterisation of the <cite>Filostrato</cite>. The two youths Palemon
and Arcite are alike in their artificiality; they have
never breathed the air we breathe, and we care nothing
for or against them. And it would be the same with
Emilia, but that her absolute stupidity angers us, and we
soon come to find her unbearable. She is always praying
the gods to give her the man she loves for a husband, but
she herself is absolutely ignorant which of the two he
may be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>But it might seem that the last thing Boccaccio thought
of here was the creation of an impersonal work of art.
His intention was rather to express his own sufferings.
In the agonies of Palemon and Arcite he wished Fiammetta
to see his own misery; and it may be that in the
protection of Venus by which Palemon got at last what
he most desired, he wished to tell Fiammetta that he too
expected to triumph, even then, by virtue of his passion,
the singleness of his love. Certainly, he seemed to say,
you are worthy of the love of heroes, but it is the heart
of a poet that Venus protects and satisfies; then give me
your grace, since I am so faithful. That something of this
sort was in his mind is obvious from the dedicatory letter
to Fiammetta.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>As for the sources from which Boccaccio had the tale,
we have seen that he certainly knew the <cite>Thebais</cite> of
Statius,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> but it was not only from Statius that he borrowed;
he used also, as Crescini<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> has proved, the <cite>Roman de
Thèbes</cite>, especially towards the end of his poem. Nor
must we altogether pass over the influence of the <cite>Æneid</cite>,
in which he found not only the form, but often the substance
of his work.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>The first edition of the <cite>Teseide</cite>, full of faults, was published
in Ferrara in 1475 by Pietro Andrea Bassi. As for
translations, there have been many, the first being a Greek
version issued in Venice in 1529. There followed an
Italian prose paraphrase published in Lucca in 1579;
while in 1597 a French version was published in Paris.
The most famous translation or rather paraphrase was
made, however, by Chaucer for the Knight's Tale in the
<cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>; and of this I speak elsewhere.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the shadow of Virgil's tomb, in a classic country still
full of an old renown, Boccaccio had followed classic
models, had written two epics and a romance in the
manner of Apuleius; but in Tuscany, the country of
Dante and Petrarch, he came under the influence of
different work, and we find him writing pastorals. The
<cite>Ameto</cite> is a pastoral romance written in prose scattered
with verses, and to the superficial reader it cannot but
be full of weariness. The action takes place in the
country about Florence under the hills of Fiesole in the
woods there, and begins with the description of the rude
hunter Ameto (<span title="admêtos">ἄδμητος</span>), who only thinks of the chase and
of the way through the forest<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>. Then he comes upon a
nymph, Lia by name, and scarcely has he seen her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
heard her sing than he loves her. After many pages of
description of the love of Ameto, the struggle between his
love and his timidity, he tells Lia at last that he loves her,
and makes her accompany him in the chase. Winter
comes, however, and separates them. But in the spring
Ameto finds her again near a temple in which are gathered
a company of fauns, dryads, satyrs, and naiads. There
too in a private place a party of nymphs and shepherds
meet close to Ameto and Lia. Many pages of description
follow concerning each of the six nymphs, Mopsa, Emilia,
Fiammetta, Acrimonia, Agapes, and Adiona. These descriptions
are very wearying, for they are almost exactly
alike, so like, indeed, that we may think Boccaccio was
describing one woman and that Fiammetta. One after
another these nymphs tell their amorous adventures, and
each closes her account with a song in <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">terza rima</i>. Then
Venus appears in the form of a column of fire,<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> and
Ameto not being able to support the sight of the goddess,
the nymphs come to his aid. When he is himself again,
he prays the goddess to be favourable to his love.</p>

<p>Till now the pagan and sensual character of the book is
complete, but here Ameto suddenly sees the error of his
ways, all is changed in a moment, the spiritual beauty of
the nymphs seems to him to surpass altogether their
physical beauty. He understands that their loves are not
men; the gods and temples about which they discourse
are not those of the Pagans, and he is ashamed to
have loved one of them as he might have loved any
mortal girl. Then suddenly he breaks into a hymn in
honour of the Trinity, and they all return to their own
homes. Thus the work ends without telling us of the
fate of Ameto or the nymphs.</p>

<p>The book, however, full as it is of imitations of Dante,
is an allegory within an allegory. The nymphs and
shepherds are not real people, but it seems personifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of the four cardinal virtues and the three theological
virtues and their opposites. Thus Mopsa is Wisdom,
and she loves Afron, Foolishness; Emilia is Justice,
and she loves Ibrida, Pride; Adiona is Temperance, and
she loves Dioneo, Licence; Acrimonia is Fortitude, and
she loves Apaten, Insensibility; Agapes is Charity,
and she loves Apiros, Indifference; Fiammetta is Hope,
and she loves Caleone, Despair; Lia is Faith, and
she loves Ameto, Ignorance. In their songs the seven
nymphs praise and exalt the seven divinities that correspond
to the seven virtues which they impersonate;
thus Pallas is praised by Mopsa (Wisdom), Diana by
Emilia (Justice), Pomona by Adiona (Temperance),
Bellona by Acrimonia (Fortitude), Venus by Agapes
(Charity), Vesta by Fiammetta (Hope), and Cibele by Lia
(Faith). The whole action of the work then becomes
symbolical, and Boccaccio, it has been said, had the intention
of showing that a man, however rude and savage, can
find God only by means of the seven virtues which are
the foundation of all morals. If such were his intention
he has indeed chosen strange means of carrying it out.
The stories of the seven nymphs are extremely licentious,
and all confess that they do not love their husbands and
are seeking to make the shepherds fall in love with them.
All this is, as we see, obscure, medieval, and far-fetched.
Let it be what it may be. It is not in this allegory
we shall find much to interest us, but in certain other
allusions in which the work is rich. Thus we shall note
that Fiammetta is Hope, and that she gives Hope to
Caleone, who is Despair. That Caleone is Boccaccio himself
there can be no manner of doubt. We see then that
at the time the <cite>Ameto</cite> was written he still had some hope
of winning Fiammetta again. In fact in the <cite>Ameto</cite>
Fiammetta has the mission of saving Caleone from death,
for he is resolved to kill himself. I have spoken of the
autobiographical allusions in the <cite>Ameto</cite>, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> It will be sufficient to say here that the <cite>Ameto</cite>
was written, as Boccaccio himself tells us, in order that
he might tell freely without regret or fear what he had
seen and heard. It is all his life that we find in the stories
of the nymphs. Emilia tells of Boccaccino's love for
Jeanne (Gannai), his desertion of her, his marriage, and
his ruin. Fiammetta tells how her mother was seduced
by King Robert, who is here called Midas.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Then she
describes the passion of Caleone (Boccaccio), his nocturnal
surprise of her, and his triumph. The work is in fact a
complete biography; and since this is so, there are in
fact no sources from which it can be said to be derived.
We find there some imitations of the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>,
some hints from Ovid and Virgil, of Moschus and Theocritus.
The <cite>Ameto</cite> was dedicated to Niccola di Bartolo
del Bruno, his "only friend in time of trouble." It was
first published in small quarto in Rome in 1478. It has
never been translated into any language.</p>

<p>There follows the <cite>Amorosa Visione</cite>, which was almost
certainly begun immediately after the <cite>Ameto</cite>; at any rate,
all modern authorities are agreed that it was written
between 1341 and 1344. It recalls the happier time of
his love, and Fiammetta is the very soul of the poem.
Written in <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">terza rima</i>, not its only likeness to the <cite>Divine
Comedy</cite>, it is dedicated to Maria d'Aquino (Fiammetta)
in an acrostic, which is solved by reading the initial letters
of the first verse of each <i>terzina</i>; the result being two
sonnets and a ballata.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> The name of "Madonna Maria"

<p>As the title proclaims, the poem is a Vision&mdash;a vision
which Love discovers to the poet-lover. While he is
falling asleep a lady appears to him who is to be his
guide. He follows her in a dream, and together they
come to a noble <i>castello</i>; there by a steep stairway they
enter into the promised land, as it were, of Happiness,
choosing not the wearying road of Good to the left, but
passing through a wide portal into a spacious room on
the right, whence come delicious sounds of <i>festa</i>. Two
youths, one dressed in white, the other in red, after
disputing with his guide, lead him into the <i>festa</i>, where
he sees four triumphs&mdash;of Wisdom, of Fame, of Love, and
of Fortune. In the triumph of Wisdom he sees all the
learned men, philosophers, and poets of the world, among
them Homer, Virgil, and Cicero, Horace, Sallust, Livy,
Galen, Cato, Apuleius, Claudian, Martial, and Dante.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> In
the triumph of Fame he sees all the famous heroes and
heroines of Antiquity and the Middle Age, among them
Saturn, Electra, Baal, Paris, Absalom, Hecuba, Brutus,
Jason, Medea, Hannibal, Cleopatra, Cornelia, Giulia, and
Solomon, Charlemagne, Charles of Apulia, and Corradino.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
The uniformity of the descriptions is pleasantly interrupted
by certain apparitions, among them Robert of
Naples<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and Boccaccino,

<p class="noindent">After all, it is the experience of all who have been poor for
a season.</p>

<p>There follows the triumph of Love, in which he sees all
the fortunate and unfortunate lovers famous in poetry from
the mythology of Greece to Lancelot and Guinevere, and
Tristram and Iseult; and among these he sees Fiammetta.</p>

<p>So we pass to the triumph of Fortune, in which we learn
the stories of Thebes, of Troy, of Carthage, of Alexander,

of terrestrial things.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> And thus disillusioned, the poet
makes the firm resolve to follow his guide in spite of
every temptation. Yet almost at once a certain beautiful
garden destroys his resolve. For he enters there and
finds a marvellous fountain of marble, and a company of
fair women who are presented to him under mysterious
pseudonyms.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Among these are the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bella Lombarda</i>, the

used.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Boccaccio has evidently studied the great poem
very closely. He imitates it not only in motives and
symbols and words, but, as we have seen, in the form of his
verse, and to some extent in the construction of his poem,
which consists of fifty <i>capitoli</i>, each composed of twenty-nine
<i>terzine</i> and a verse of <i>chiusa</i>, that is of eighty-eight
verses in each.</p>

<p>The first edition was published in Milan in 1521 with
an <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Apologia contro ai detrattori della poesia del Boccaccio</cite>

<p>We turn now to the <cite>Fiammetta</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> which must have been
the last of the works directly concerned with his passion for
Maria d'Aquino. Crescini<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> thinks it was written in 1343,
but others<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> assure us that it is later work.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Crescini's
argument is, however, so formidable that we shall do
better to accept his conclusions and to consider the
<cite>Fiammetta</cite> as a work of this first Florentine period.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>Though concerned with the same subject, his love, the
allegory is worth noting, for while in all the other books
concerned with Fiammetta he assures us he was betrayed
by her, here he asserts that Panfilo (himself) betrayed
Fiammetta! Moreover, he warns us that here he speaks
the truth,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> but in fact it is only here he is a liar. It is impossible
to believe that every one had not penetrated his
various disguises, and he must have known that this was,
and would be, so. Wishing, then, both to revenge and to
vindicate himself&mdash;for his "betrayal" still hurt him keenly&mdash;and
guessing that Fiammetta would read the book, he
tells us that it was he who left her, not she him. The book
then is very amusing for us who are behind the scenes, as
it was, doubtless, for many of those who read it in
his day.</p>

<p>The action is very simple, the story being told by Fiammetta
as though it were an autobiography. It begins with
a dream in which Fiammetta is warned that great unhappiness
is in store for her. She knows Panfilo,<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> and
suddenly there arises between them an eager love.
Warned of the danger they run in entertaining so impetuous
a passion, they yet take no heed; till quite as
suddenly as it had begun, their love is broken. Panfilo
must go away, it seems, being recalled to Florence by his
old father. In vain Fiammetta tries to detain him; she
can only obtain from him a promise that he will return to
Naples in four months. The ingenious lying in that!</p>

<p>All alone she passes her days and nights in weeping.
The four months pass and Panfilo does not come back to
her. One day she hears from a merchant that he has taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>a wife in Florence. This news increases her agony, and
she asks aid of Venus. Then her husband, seeing her to
be ill, but unaware of the cause of her sufferings, takes her
to Baia; but no distraction helps her, and Baia only
reminds her of the bygone days she spent there with
Panfilo. At last she hears from a faithful servant come
from Florence that Panfilo has not taken a wife, that the
young woman in his house is the new wife of his old
father; but it seems though he be unmarried he is in love
with another lady, which is even worse. New jealousy
and lamentations of Fiammetta. She refuses to be comforted
and thinks only of death and suicide, and even tries
to throw herself from her window, but is prevented.
Finally the return of Panfilo is announced. Fiammetta
thanks Venus and adorns herself again. She waits; but
Panfilo does not come, and at last she is reduced to
comforting herself by thinking of all those who suffer from
love even as she. The work closes with a sort of epilogue.</p>

<p>As a work of art the <cite>Fiammetta</cite> is the best thing
Boccaccio has yet achieved. The psychology is fine,
subtle, and full of insight, but not so dramatic nor so
simple and profound as that in the <cite>Filostrato</cite>. He shows
again that he understands a woman's innermost nature,
her continual doubts of herself, her gift of introspection.
The torment of soul that a deserted woman suffers, the
helpless fury of jealousy, are studied and explained with
marvellous knowledge and coolness. The husband, who,
ignorant of all, is so sorry for his wife's unhappiness, and
seeks to console and comfort her, really lives and is the
fine prototype of a lot of base work done later in which
the cruel absurdity of the situation and the ridiculous
figure he cuts who plays his part in it are insisted on. In
fact, in the <cite>Fiammetta</cite> we find many of the finest features
of the <cite>Decameron</cite>. It is the first novel of psychology
ever written in Europe.</p>

<p>The sources of the <cite>Fiammetta</cite> are hard and perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>impossible to trace. It seems to have no forbears.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> One
thinks of Ovid's <cite>Heroides</cite>, but that has little to do with it.

<p>From this intense psychological novel Boccaccio seems
to have turned away with a sort of relief, the relief the
poet always finds in mere singing, to the <cite>Ninfale Fiesolano</cite>.
Licentious, and yet full of a marvellous charm, full of that
love of nature, too, which is by no means a mere convention,
the <cite>Ninfale Fiesolano</cite> is the most mature of his poems
in the vulgar tongue.</p>

<p>The sources he drew from for this beautiful poem, so full
of learning, but fuller still of a genuine love of nature,
prove to us that it was, in its completeness, a mature work.
It is derived in part from the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> of Ovid, from
the <cite>Æneid</cite>, and from Achilles Tatius, a Greek romancer of
Alexandria who lived in the fifth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span><a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Moreover,
the <cite>Ninfale</cite> is a pastoral poem that is in no way at all
concerned with chivalry; it is wholly Latin, full of nature
and the bright fields, expressed with a Latin rhetoric.
Curiously enough it has never had much success, especially
out of Italy; and though it be voluptuous, it is by no
means the immoral book it has been called.</p>

<p>This, as we have seen, is the third poem which Boccaccio
wrote in <i>ottave</i>, and it has been stated, not without insistence,
that he was in fact the inventor, or at any rate the
renewer, of that metre in Italian.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>The truth seems to lie with Baldelli. The Sicilians had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>written <i>ottave</i>, but they had but two <i>rime</i>, and were akin
to those of the Provençals. What Boccaccio did was to
take this somewhat arid scheme and give it life by reforming
it out of all recognition. Moreover, if he was not
actually the first poet to write <i>ottave</i> in Italian, he was the
first to put them to epic use. There are in fact, properly
speaking, no Italian epics before the poems of Boccaccio.</p>

<p>As for the <cite>Ninfale Fiesolano</cite>, it was first published in
Venice in 1477 by Bruno Valla and Tommaso d' Alessandria.
It has only been translated once&mdash;into French&mdash;by
Anton Guercin du Crest, who published it in Lyons in
1556 at the shop of Gabriel Cotier. This was apparently
the last poem on which Boccaccio was engaged&mdash;though
it may have been put aside for the sake of the <cite>Fiammetta</cite>,
and taken up again&mdash;before, about 1344, it seems, he returned
to Naples.</p>

<p class="pfs90">1341-1343</p>
<p class="pfs90 w-sp">IN FLORENCE&mdash;HIS FATHER'S SECOND MARRIAGE&mdash;THE
DUKE OF ATHENS</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">Those</span> years which Boccaccio spent in Florence
between 1341 and 1345, and which would seem
for the most part to have been devoted to
literature, the completion of the works already
begun in Naples, the composition of the <cite>Amorosa Visione</cite>,
the <cite>Fiammetta</cite>, and the <cite>Ninfale Fiesolano</cite>, were personally
among the most unhappy of his life, while publicly they
brought the republic of Florence to the verge of ruin.
And indeed he was an unwilling victim. That he hated
leaving Naples might seem obvious from his own circumstances
at that time; nor were the political conditions
of Florence encouraging. He had left a city friendly
to men of letters, full of all manner of splendour, rich,
peaceful, and, above all, governed by one authority, the
king, for a distracted republic divided against itself and
scarcely able to support a costly foreign war.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Nor were the
conditions of his father's house any more pleasing to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Soured by misfortune, Boccaccino seems at this time to
have been a melancholy and hard old man. The picture
Giovanni gives us of him is perhaps coloured by resentment,
and indeed he had never forgiven his father for the
desertion of the girl he had seduced, the little French girl
Jeanne, Giovanni's mother;<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> but it is with a quite personal
sense of resentment he describes the home to which he
returned from Naples&mdash;that house in the S. Felicità quarter
which Boccaccino had bought in 1333:<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> "Here one laughs
but seldom. The dark, silent, melancholy house keeps
and holds me altogether against my will, where the dour
and terrible aspect of an old man frigid, uncouth, and
miserly continually adds affliction to my saddened
mood."<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> That was in 1341 one may think; and no
doubt the loss of Fiammetta, his own poverty, and the
confusion of public affairs in Florence added to his
depression; and then he was always easily cast down.
But as it happened, things were already improving for
him.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in the romance which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>passes under her name Fiammetta tells us that Panfilo
(Giovanni), when he deserted her, promised to return in
four months. Later<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> she says, when the promised time of
his return had passed by more than a month, she heard
from a merchant lately arrived in Naples that her lover
fifteen days before had taken a wife in Florence.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Great
distress on the part of Fiammetta; but, as she soon learnt,
it was not Giovanni, but his father, who had married himself.</p>

<p>Is there any truth in this story? Assuredly there is.
We know, indeed, that Boccaccino did marry a second wife,
whose name was Bice de' Bostichi, and that she bore him
a son, Jacopo;<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> but we do not know when either of these
events happened. If we may trust the <cite>Fiammetta</cite>, which
says clearly that Giovanni's father married again about
five months after his son returned home, and if we are
right in thinking that that return took place in January,
1341, then Boccaccino married his second wife in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>spring, or more precisely in May, 1341. That they were
man and wife in May, 1343,<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> we know, for, thanks to
Crescini, we have a document which proves it. Beyond
that fact all is conjecture in this matter. Yet it is significant
that we find Boccaccino, on December 13, 1342,
acquiring half a house in the popolo di S. Ambrogio in
Florence,<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> and yet, as we know from the document just
quoted,<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> in May, 1343, he was still living in popolo di
S. Felicità.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> For what possible reason could Boccaccino,
ruined as he was, want half a house in which he did not
propose to live? Had family history repeated itself?
Was Giovanni in some sort again turned out of his
father's house by his second stepmother as he had been
by the first, and for a like reason&mdash;the birth of a legitimate
son? It was for him, then, that Boccaccino bought
the half-house in popolo di S. Ambrogio, and the occasion
was the birth of Jacopo his son by Madonna Bice? It is
possible, at any rate; and when we remember the efforts
the old man had already made in his poverty for the comfort
of a son who had disappointed him in everything, it
seems more than likely. Nor can we but accuse Giovanni
of ingratitude when we think of his constant allusions to
his father's avarice and remember these benefits.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Such, then, are the few and meagre personal events that
have in any way come down to us of Boccaccio's life while
he was writing all or nearly all those works of his youth
which we have already examined, between his return to
Florence in January, 1341, and his departure once more
for Naples in 1344 or 1345.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>These years, materially none too happy for him but full
after all of successful work, were disastrous for Florence.
That tranquillity and internal peace which so happily followed
the death of Castruccio Castracani and of Charles of
Calabria in 1328, in which, among other splendid things,
Giotto's tower was built, had been broken in 1340, when the
<i>grandi</i>, who held the government, having grown oppressive,
a rebellion headed by Piero de' Baldi and Bardo Frescobaldi
was only crushed by a rising of the people. Things
were quiet then for a moment, but the <i>grandi</i> would heed
no warning, and as one might expect, their insolence grew
with their power. Nor was it only at home that things were
going unhappily for Florence. When Louis of Bavaria,
who claimed the empire against the will of the Pope, left
Italy&mdash;it was the Visconti who had called him across the
Alps in fear of the House of Anjou&mdash;some of his Germans,
after Castruccio's death, seized Lucca and offered to sell it
to the Florentines, who refused it. They repented later; and
when it had come into the hands of Martino della Scala
of Verona and Parma, who, in straits himself on account of
Visconti, offered to sell it again, they found a competitor
in Pisa, who was ready to dispute the city with them.
Nevertheless they bought it, only to find that the Pisans,
knowing the wealth of Florence and expecting this, had sat
down before it. A war followed in which nothing but dishonour
came the way of Florence, and Lucca fell into the
hands of Pisa. This so enraged the Florentines that they
rose against the <i>grandi</i>, who, at their wits' end what to do,
asked their old ally Robert of Naples for help. This was
in 1341. It was not, therefore, to a very prosperous or
joyful city that Boccaccio returned from Naples; the
words he put into the mouth of Fiammetta<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> were fully
justified.</p>

<p>King Robert, however, did not send help to Florence at
once. He was thinking always of Sicily and had been busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
with the conquest of the Lipari Islands,<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> but when he did
send it, in the person of Walter, Duke of Athens and
Count of Brienne, a French baron, it proved to be the
worst disaster of all. Yet at first the Florentines rejoiced,
for they knew Walter of old, who had been vicegerent in
Florence for Charles of Calabria in 1325, and as Machiavelli
tells us, his behaviour had been so modest that every one
loved him. That was not his attitude now, nor does it
tally with Boccaccio's lively account of him,<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> which certainly
reads like the work of an eye-witness and supports
our belief that he was in Florence during 1342 and 1343&mdash;those
disastrous years.</p>

<p>For as it happened, the Duke arrived in Florence at the
very time when the enterprise of Lucca was utterly lost.
The <i>grandi</i>, however, hoping to appease the people, at
once made him Conservator and later General. But they
had alienated every one. The <i>nobili</i>, long since their
enemies, had always maintained a correspondence with
the Duke ever since he had been vicegerent for Charles of
Calabria; they thought now that their chance was come
when they might be avenged alike on the <i>grandi</i> and the
people; so they pressed him to take the government
wholly into his hands. The people, on the other hand,
smarting under new taxes and oppression and insolence
and defeat, to a large extent joined the <i>nobili</i> against the
<i>grandi</i>. In this conspiracy we find all the names of the
great popular families, Peruzzi, Acciaiuoli, Antellesi, and
Buonaccorsi, whom the unsuccessful war, among other
things, had ruined, and who hoped thus to free themselves
from their creditors.</p>

<p>The Duke's ambition, being thus pampered and exasperated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>over-reached itself. To please the people he put to
death those who had the management of the war, Giovanni
de' Medici, Nardo Rucellai, and Guglielmo Altoviti, and
banished some and fined others. And thus his reputation
was increased, and indeed a general fear of him spread
through the city, so that to show their affection towards
him people caused his arms to be painted upon their
houses, and nothing but the bare title was wanting to
make him their Prince.</p>

<p>Being now sure of his success, he caused it to be
signified to the Government that for the public good he
judged it best that they should transfer their authority
upon him, and that he desired their resignation. At first
they refused, but when by proclamation he required all the
people to appear before him in the Piazza di S. Croce (for
he was living in the convent as a sign of his humility), they
protested, and then consented that the government should
be conferred upon him for a year with the same conditions
as those with which it had been formerly given to Charles
of Calabria.</p>

<p>So on September 8, 1342, the Duke, accompanied by
Giovanni della Tosca and many citizens, came into the
Piazza della Signoria with the Senate, and, mounting on
the Rhingiera, he caused the articles of agreement between
him and the Senate to be read. Now when he who read
them came to the place where it was written that the
government should be his for a year, the people cried out,
"For his life. For his life." It is true, Francesco
Rustichesi, one of the Signori, rose up and tried to speak,
but they would not hear him. Thus the Duke was chosen
lord by consent of the people not for a year, but for ever;
and afterwards he was taken and carried through the
multitude with general acclamation. Now the first thing
he did was to seize the Palazzo della Signoria, where he
set up his own standard, while the Palazzo itself was
plundered by his servants; and all this was done to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
satisfaction of those who maliciously or ignorantly had
consented to his exaltation.</p>

<p>The Duke was no sooner secure in his dominion than he
forbade the Signori to meet in the Palazzo, recalled the
Baldi and the Frescobaldi, made peace with the Pisans,
and took away their bills and assignments from the
merchants who had lent money in the war of Lucca.
He dissolved the authority of the <i>Signori</i> and set up in
their place three <i>Rettori</i>, with whom he constantly advised.
The taxes he laid upon the people were great, all his
judgments were unjust, and all men saw his cruelty and
pride, while many citizens of the more noble and wealthy
sort were condemned, executed, and tortured. He was
jealous of the <i>nobili</i>, so he applied himself to the people,
cajoling them and scheming into their favour, hoping thus
to secure his tyranny for ever. In the month of May, for
instance, when the people were wont to be merry, he
caused the common people to be disposed into several
companies, gave them ensigns and money, so that half the
city went up and down feasting and junketing, while the
other half was busy to entertain them. And his fame
grew abroad, so that many persons of French extraction
repaired to him, and he preferred them all, for they were his
faithful friends; so that in a short while Florence was not
only subject to Frenchmen, but to French customs and
garb, men and women both, without decency or moderation,
imitating them in all things. But that which was
incomparably the most displeasing was the violence he
and his creatures used to the women. In these conditions
it is not surprising that plots to get rid of him grew and
multiplied. He cared not. When Matteo di Morrozzo, to
ingratiate himself with the Duke, discovered to him a
plot which the Medici had contrived with others against
him, he caused him to be put to death. And when
Bettone Cini spoke against the taxes he caused his tongue
to be pulled out by the roots so that he died of it. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
was his cruelty and folly. But indeed this last outrage
completed the rest. The people grew mad, for they who
had been used to speak of everything freely could not
brook to have their mouths stopped up by a stranger.
"When," asks Machiavelli, "did the Florentines know
how to maintain liberty or to endure slavery?" However,
things were indeed at such a pass that the most servile
people would have tried to recover its freedom.</p>

<p>Many citizens of every sort, we hear, resolved to destroy
him, and out of this hatred grew three serious conspiracies
by three sorts of people: the <i>grandi</i>, the people, and the
<i>arti</i>. The <i>grandi</i> hated him for he had robbed them of
the government, the people because he had not given it to
them, the <i>arti</i> because they were ruined. With the first
were concerned the Bardi, Rossi, Frescobaldi, Scali, Altoviti,
Mazalotti, Strozzi, and Mancini, with the Archbishop of
Florence; with the second, Manno and Corso Donati, the
Pazzi, Cavicciulli, Cerchi, and Albizzi; with the third,
Antonio Adimari, the Medici, Bordini, Rucellai, and
Aldobrandini.</p>

<p>The plan was to kill him on the feast of S. John
Baptist, June 24, 1343, in the house of the Albizzi,
whither, as it was thought, he would go to see the <i>palio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>But he went not and that design was lost. The next proposal
was to kill him as he walked in the streets, but that
was found difficult, because he was always well armed and
attended and, moreover, very uncertain. Then it was
debated to slay him in the Council, but this too was
dangerous, for even should they succeed they would remain
at the mercy of his guards. Suddenly all was discovered.
The Duke learnt of the plots through the quite innocent
action of a Sienese. He was both surprised and angry;
and that is strange. At first he proposed to kill every
man of all the families I have named; but he had not
force enough to do it openly, so he in his turn plotted.
He called the chief citizens to council, meaning to slay
them there. But they got wind of it, and knowing not
whom to trust, confessed at last to one another their three
conspiracies and swore to stand together and get rid of the
Duke.</p>

<p>Their plan was this: the next day, as it happened, was
the feast of S. Anne, July 26, 1343, and they decided
that then a tumult should be raised in the Mercato
Vecchio, upon which all were to take arms and excite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>people to liberty. And the next day, the signal being
given by sounding a bell as had been agreed, all took
arms and, crying out, "Liberty, liberty," excited the people,
who took arms likewise. The Duke, alarmed at this noise,
fortified himself in the Palazzo and then, calling home his
servants who were lodged through the city, set forth with
them to the Mercato. Many times were they assaulted on
the way and many too were slain, so that though recruited
with three hundred horse he knew not himself what to do.
Meantime the Medici, Cavicciulli, and Rucellai, who were
afraid lest he should attack, drawing together a force,
advanced so that many of those who had stood for the
Duke rallied over to their side, and though the Duke was
again reinforced, yet was he beaten and went backward
into the Palazzo. Meanwhile Corso and Amerigo Donati
with part of the people broke up the prisons, burned the
records of the Potestà, sacked the houses of the <i>rettori</i>, and
killed all the Duke's officers they could meet with. And
the Duke remained besieged in the Palazzo. Has not
Boccaccio told us the story:&mdash;</p>

<p>While the Duke was thus besieged, the citizens to give
some form to their government met in S. Reparata (S. Maria
del Fiore) and created fourteen of their number, half <i>grandi</i>
half people, to rule with the Bishop. Then the Duke asked
for a truce. They refused it, except Guglielmo of Assisi,
with his son, and Cerrettieri Bisdomini, who had always
been of his party, should be delivered into their hands.
This for long the Duke refused, but at last, seeing no way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
out, he consented. "Greater, doubtless," says Machiavelli,
"is the insolence and contumacy of the people and more
dreadful the evils which they do in pursuit of liberty
than when they have acquired it." So it proved here.
Guglielmo and his son were brought forth and delivered
up among thousands of their enemies. His son was a
youth of less than eighteen years; yet that did not spare
him nor his beauty neither. Those who could not get near
enough to do it whilst he was alive wounded him when he
was dead; and as if their swords had been partial and too
moderate, they fell to it with their teeth and their hands,
biting his flesh and tearing it in pieces. And that all
their senses might participate in their revenge, having
feasted their ears upon groans, their eyes upon wounds,
their touch upon the bowels of their enemies which they
rent out of their bodies with their hands, they regaled their
taste also. Those two gentlemen, father and son, were
eaten in the Piazza; only Cerrettieri escaped, for the people,
being tired, forgot him altogether and left him in the
Palazzo not so much as demanded, and the next night he
was conveyed out of the city.</p>

<p>Satiated thus with blood, they suffered the Duke to
depart peacefully on August 6, attended by a host of
citizens who saw him on the way to the Casentino, where,
in fact, though unwillingly it seems, he ratified the renunciation.</p>

<p>And all these things befell in Florence while Giovanni
Boccaccio was writing in the popolo di S. Felicità and in
the popolo di S. Ambrogio in the years 1341, 1342, and
1343. In 1344, as we may believe, Boccaccio returned to
Naples.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">Those</span> three years of tumult in Florence cannot
but have made a profound impression on
a man like Boccaccio. "Florence is full of
boastful voices and cowardly deeds," he writes
in the <cite>Fiammetta</cite>, while his account of the Duke in the

old splendour and gaiety he had once enjoyed there, he
must indeed have been disappointed. Already, before he
returned to Florence in 1341, the rule of King Robert, who
was then in his last years, had weakened; and factions were
already forming which, when the wise king passed away,
were not slow to divide the city against itself. No doubt
the splendid reception offered to Petrarch, the gaiety of all
that, served to hide the dangerous condition of affairs, which
was not rendered less insecure by the fact that King
Robert's heir was a girl still in her first youth, Giovanna
the beautiful, daughter of Charles of Calabria.</p>

enthusiastic is proved by the frescoes in S. Maria dell' Incoronata.</p>

<p>In 1342 Giovanna was entering her seventeenth year,
while Andrew of Hungary, her betrothed, was but fifteen.
On Easter Day in that year King Robert invested him
with the insignia of knighthood, and four days later he
was to have been married to the Princess, but the death
first of Pope Benedict (April 25th), and then of the King
of Hungary, his father (July 15th), prevented the ceremony,
so that it was not till August that it could take
place, and then quite suddenly King Robert the Wise died,
aged sixty-four, on January 19th, 1343. In the frock of
a Franciscan tertiary they buried him in S. Chiara, behind
the high altar, and Sancius and Johannes of Florence
presently built there the great and beautiful tomb we
know.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>So said Petrarch.</p>

<p>Now by his Will, as was inevitable, Robert appointed
his granddaughter Giovanna his successor and heiress to
all his dominions&mdash;including Provence and most of his
Piedmontese possessions; he left her too the unrestored
island of Sicily and the title of Jerusalem. In case of her
death all was to pass to Maria her sister, who later married
the Duke of Durazzo. During Giovanna's minority and
that of her husband Andrew of Hungary, which were to
last till they were twenty-five, the Will vested the
government in a Supreme Council which was in fact
dominated by the Dowager Queen Sancia, and was composed
of Philip de Cabassoles, Bishop of Cavaillon, vice-chancellor
of the realm on behalf of the suzerain Holy
See, Charles d'Artois, Count of S. Agata, natural son of
King Robert, Goffredo Marzano, Count of Squillace,
admiral of the Kingdom, and Filippo di Sanguinetto,
Count of Altomonte, seneschal in Provence. It thus
appears that the intention of the King was to keep the
throne in his own line, certainly not to make Andrew of
Hungary king in Naples. The two branches of his house
had had, it will be remembered, almost equal rights to the
throne, and if Clement V for his own good had decided in
favour of the younger branch, that is in favour of Robert,
though Charles Martel of Hungary, Andrew's father, submitted
to the Papal decision, Robert had thought it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>prudent to make voluntarily a kind of composition of his
rights and the claims of his brothers in arranging the
marriage between Andrew his nephew and his granddaughter
Giovanna. It will thus be seen that Giovanna's
marriage was a political act designed to establish peace
between the descendants of Charles d'Anjou.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> That no
peace but a sword came of it we shall see.</p>

<p>King Robert had not been dead many months when
the Hungarians, sure of Andrew's protection, began to
flock to Naples. They angered those who surrounded
the Queen and even the Queen herself by their insolence,
and thus the court was divided into two parties, or rather
there were two courts in one palace.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1343 Petrarch was once more in
Naples. In a letter to Barbato di Sulmona he pays
an eloquent tribute to King Robert, and at the same
time states his reasons for anxiety as to the condition
of the Kingdom. "I fear as much from the youthfulness
of the Queen and her consort as from the age and
ideas of the Queen Dowager; but I am especially afraid
of the administration and manners of the court. Perhaps
I am a bad prophet: I hope so. But I seem to see two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
lambs in the care of a pack of wolves...." Touching on
the administration, Petrarch gives the following account of
Fra Roberto, the Franciscan confessor of Andrew. "I
encountered a deformed creature, barefooted, hoodless,
vainglorious in his poverty, degenerate through his sensuality;
in fact, a homunculus, bald and rubicund, with
bloated limbs.... Would you hear his revered name?
He is called 'Robert.' Yes, in the place of the noblest of
kings, till lately the glory of our age, has arisen this Robert
who, on the contrary, will disgrace it. Nor will I henceforth
hold it a fable they relate of a serpent able to be
generated from a buried corpse, since from the royal
sepulchre has issued this reptile." And indeed of all the
court he has a good word for Philip de Cabassoles only:
"he who alone stands up on the side of justice."</p>

<p>So much for the administration; nor were the manners
he found there any better, in his judgment. The whole city
was divided against itself, and life was altogether insecure.
The council is "compelled to end its sittings at sunset, for
the turbulent young nobles make the streets quite unsafe
after dark. And what wonder if they are unruly and
society corrupt, when the public authorities actually
countenance all the horrors of gladiatorial games?
These disgusting exhibitions take place in open day
before the court and populace in this city of Italy with
more than barbaric ferocity."<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>The vicious life of this and the following years in Naples
is usually attributed to the example and influence of
Queen Giovanna. In fact nothing can be further from the
truth. In King Robert's time the court life was, as we
have seen, very far from being exemplary, but Giovanna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
herself was not weak and abandoned. Already Hungary
was pressing the claims of Andrew to equal if not superior
power to hers. She never flinched for a moment; from
the hour she perceived the way things were drifting she
determined to win.</p>

<p>At first things seemed altogether against her. In June,
1344, she wrote to Charles of Durazzo, her sister's husband,
telling him that Cardinal Aimeric, the Papal Legate, had
entered her kingdom without her leave, and that therefore
she and Andrew were gone to Aversa to meet him.
There she made peace, acknowledged the Cardinal as
Regent, and admitted her crown to be held from the
Holy See. Andrew signed her proclamation as a mere
witness.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> But this intrusion of the Papacy by no means
improved chances of peace.</p>

<p>The coming of Andrew, with his Hungarian pretensions
and those crowds of needy foreign place-hunters, angered
the Neapolitan people it is true, but it infuriated the long-established
group of domestic functionaries in Castel
Nuovo, who in some sort had been confirmed in their
offices by the Will of King Robert. The head of this court
party, as whole-heartedly against Andrew as it was against
the Pope, was Filippa la Catanese, now quite an old
woman. Among her family were Raimondo the seneschal,
Sancia de Cabannis, Contessa di Morcone, her
granddaughter, wife of Carlo di Gambatesa, Roberto
de Cabannis, grand seneschal of the Kingdom, and his
wife. This group sided with Giovanna, and in its
own interest pushed her claims against those of Aimeric
and Andrew. They were supported more or less in
secret by Catherine of Taranto and her sons Robert
and Louis.</p>

<p>A storm was obviously brewing, and it must have been
about this time that Boccaccio returned to Naples, perhaps
on the invitation of Niccolò Acciaiuoli, secretary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
protégé of Catherine of Taranto. No doubt he hoped to
see Fiammetta&mdash;no doubt he did see her, though what
came of it we shall never know; but he found no more
peace in Naples than in Florence.</p>

<p>In February, 1345, the Pope removed Aimeric, who he
declared had succeeded in governing <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pacifice et quiete</i>.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
The Cardinal returned to Avignon, and moved in the
Consistory that Andrew be crowned king. He was supported
by Durazzo. Giovanna appealed. The Pope
listened, but ordered that Filippa la Catanese, Sancia,
Margherita, and others should be dismissed. From that
moment the Catanesi plotted to murder Andrew.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the court (then, as it happened, in
mourning for the Dowager Queen Sancia, who died July
28, 1345) to spend the summer at one of the royal palaces
outside Naples. In July Giovanna, then with child, had
gone with the court to Castellamare; in September she
moved to Aversa. On the night of the 18th, the anniversary
of Andrew's arrival in Naples, the Queen had retired
early, and Andrew too had gone early to his room, when
Tommaso, son of Mambriccio di Tropea, summoned him
from his chamber into a passage leading toward the garden,
on the pretence, as it is said, that messengers had arrived
from Naples with important despatches. In that passageway
he was seized, gagged, and strangled, and his body
thrown into the garden, where it was discovered by his
Hungarian nurse.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>It was at once whispered that the Queen was concerned
in the murder, and this rumour has been accepted as the
truth even in our own day;<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> but, in fact, there is little
or nothing to substantiate it. Her account<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> scarcely
differs from that of the Pope, but adds that a man had
been seized and executed for the crime. Then, after a
day or two, the Queen left Aversa for Naples. Andrew's
nurse remained in her service and nursed her through her
confinement in December.</p>

<p>The murder of Andrew, whose handiwork soever, effectually
divided the Kingdom into two parties, to wit those of
Durazzo and Taranto; the former demanding punishment
of the murderers. Two Cardinals, di S. Clemente and di
S. Marco, were appointed by the Pope to rule in Naples
and to exact vengeance. The Queen was helpless. On
December 25th her son was born and named Charles
Martel. As time went on and none of the assassins were
brought to justice, the Hungarians became furious, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>last requested the custody of the young prince; and
this request became a demand when it was known that
Giovanna was being sought in marriage by Robert of
Taranto, who, with his mother and his half-brother Louis,
had been covertly associated with the Catanesi. Something
had to be done, and early in 1346 we find Charles of
Durazzo with Robert of Taranto and Ugo del Balzo
seizing Raimondo the seneschal, as one of the guilty
persons. Under torture he confessed that he had knowledge
of the plot and assisted those who committed the
murder. Among his accomplices he named the Count
of Terlizzi, Roberto de Cabannis, Giovanni and Rostaino di
Lagonessa, Niccolò di Melezino, Filippa Catanese, and
Sancia de Cabannis.</p>

<p>Charles of Durazzo and Robert of Taranto therefore
determined to hunt down the Catanese family and offer it
as a peace-offering to the King of Hungary, who already
threatened to descend upon the Kingdom. At Durazzo's
instigation an armed mob surrounded Castel Nuovo hunting
for the murderers. A few had been wise enough to
flee, but most of those denounced were arrested, imprisoned
in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text was 'Castel Capuana'">Castel Capuano</ins>, and put to torture. In vain the Queen
protested against the princes' action. They achieved their
purpose and the Pope, in a Bull of March 19th, 1346,
pardoned them, asserting that God had moved them
to it.</p>

<p>The Queen, as might be expected, had now no further
wish to marry Robert of Taranto; and, indeed, finding that
she could not depend on him for help, she had already
promised herself to his half-brother Louis. In this second
marriage she begged for the favour of the Holy See. The
Pope, though not averse, bullied by Hungary, temporised.</p>

<p>Now, behind Louis of Taranto was the most astute mind
of that age, Boccaccio's old friend, Niccolò Acciaiuoli, the
Florentine. He resolved to win for his patron both the
Queen of Naples and the crown. Nor was he easily discouraged.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>Yet, at first certainly things looked black
enough for him.</p>

<p>Early in August, 1346, there had been erected along
the shore by the Castello dell' Ovo a palisade encircling a
raised platform. Here, under Ugo del Balzo, the public
torture of the suspected began. Whatever else Boccaccio
may have seen or done in Naples, it seems certain that
he was a witness of this dreadful orgie.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>But in Naples confusion followed on confusion. Without
waiting for the Pope's leave, risking an interdict, Louis of
Taranto married Giovanna in the Castel Nuovo in August,
1347, while already King Louis of Hungary was creeping
down through the Abruzzi to invade the Kingdom and
seize the city. On January 15, 1348, the Queen, with
a few friends, leaving her child behind, sailed for Provence.
Not long after Louis of Taranto and Acciaiuoli reached
Naples, and, finding her departed, took ship for Tuscany.
With them, according to Witte, went Boccaccio. However
that may be, when next we hear of him he is in Romagna
at the court of Ostasio da Polenta. Louis of Taranto and
Acciaiuoli, with or without him, landed at Porto Ercole
of the Counts Orsini of Sovana, and two days later del
Balzo surrendered Castel dell' Ovo with the young Prince
Charles Martel. King Louis was then at Aversa, where
he captured Philip of Taranto and Louis of Durazzo who
had come to treat with him. Then Charles of Durazzo
was seized, tried for the murder of Andrew, and condemned:
and they took him to Aversa and struck off his head
on the scene of the crime. But even the Neapolitans, who
had in fact taken little part in the war, if a war it can be
called, being busy with their own feuds, grew weary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
invasion, so that when King Louis demanded ransom from
them, posing as a conqueror, they proved to him that
it would be wiser to withdraw. And there were other
arguments: for the Black Death fell on his army and he
fled, leaving only enough troops to prevent Giovanna from
returning. She, poor Queen, without soldiers or money,
was compelled to cede Avignon to the Holy See for
80,000 florins, on condition that the Pope declared her
innocent of the murder of her husband and proclaimed
the legality of her second marriage. Thus the Church was
the only gainer by these appalling crimes and treasons.
Once more Israel had spoiled the Egyptians. It was not
till 1352, after the second invasion of King Louis, that
Giovanna was able to return to Naples.</p>

<p class="pfs90">1346-1350</p>
<p class="pfs90 w-sp">IN ROMAGNA&mdash;THE PLAGUE&mdash;THE DEATH OF
FIAMMETTA</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">The</span> few notices we have of Boccaccio's life at
this time are almost entirely mere hints which
enable us to assert that in such a year he was
in such a place: they in no way help us to discover
why he was there or what he was doing. Thus we are
able to affirm that probably between 1344 and 1346,
certainly in 1345, he was in Naples, but why he went there,
unless it were for the sake of Fiammetta, we cannot
suggest, for if Florence was a shambles, so was Naples.
In much the same way we know that he was in Ravenna
with Ostasio da Polenta not later than 1346; for in a
letter Petrarch wrote him in 1365 he reminds him that he
was in Ravenna "in the time of the grandfather of him
who now rules there."<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> But why Boccaccio went to Ravenna,
unless it were that, finding Naples too hot to hold
him and Florence impossible, he took refuge with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
relations he had there, or with the Polenta who had
befriended Dante, we do not know. Nor do we know
what he did there. It may be that during his stay in
Naples he had already begun to think of writing a life of
Dante; and hearing that the great poet had left a daughter
Beatrice in Ravenna he set out to see her. This, however,
is but the merest conjecture. Baldelli,<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> indeed, thinks that
Boccaccio was at this time in Romagna as ambassador for
Florence. For Ravenna was not the only place he visited
about this time. If we may believe the third <cite>Eclogue</cite>, he
was also the guest of Francesco degli Ordelaffi, the great
enemy of the Church in Romagna and of King Robert the
Wise.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>In the third <cite>Eclogue</cite> Palemone reproves Pamfilo for idly
reposing in his cave while all around the woods ring with
the cries of Testili infuriated against Fauno. Now Fauno,
as Boccaccio tells us in his letter to Frate Martino da
Signa,<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> where he explains some of the disguises of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><cite>Eclogues</cite>, is Francesco degli Ordelaffi, and Testili, although
Boccaccio does not say so, is without doubt the Church,
which had in fact no greater enemy in all Romagna than
Ordelaffo, the usurper, if you will, of the ecclesiastical
dominion, who held in contempt the many excommunications
launched against him, replying always by an attack
on some bishop, and by making continual war on the
legates sent against him.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>Those cries, and the anger which causes them, fill the
first part of the <cite>Eclogue</cite>. In the second part, it is clearly
recounted how King Louis of Hungary came down into
Italy to avenge the murder of his brother Andrew. Argo,
the head shepherd worthy to be praised by all, has
perforce abandoned the sheep.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Argo is Robert King of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>Naples,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> wise as King Solomon, who follows the Muses.
Alexis is Andrew of Hungary and Naples, who, made free
of the woods by Argo, being careless and without caution,
has been assailed by a she-wolf, pregnant and enraged, that
is by Queen Giovanna; for here, at any rate, Boccaccio
eagerly sides with the rabble and accepts the guilt of the
Queen as fact. They say, he adds, that the woods held
many cruel wild beasts and lions, and that Alexis met the
death of Adonis. Now Tityrus, that is King Louis of
Hungary, the brother of the dead Alexis, heard of this
beyond Ister or the Danube, and set forth with innumerable
hunters to punish the wolf and the lions.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> And many
Italians joined with Tityrus, says Boccaccio; among them
was Faunus, although Testili threatened him and cursed
him sore.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>What this means is obvious. The Pope, dismayed by
the descent of King Louis into Italy,<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> having tried
unsuccessfully in a thousand ways to turn him from his purpose,
hindered him as best he could when he had once set out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>The Vicar in Romagna, Astorgio di Duraforte, was ordered
not to allow him to enter any city; a papal legate met him
at Foligno, forbidding him on pain of excommunication to
enter the Kingdom. In spite of the papal prohibition the
<i>signorotti</i> of Romagna gladly entertained the king. Francesco
Ordelaffi above all, as Villani tells us,<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> "bade him
welcome, and went out to meet him in the <i>contado</i> of
Bologna with two hundred horse and a thousand foot, all
under arms. On December 13 he received him in Forlì
with the greatest honour, furnishing his needs and those
of all his people. And there they sojourned three days with
much feasting and dancing of men and women, and the
king made knights of the lord of Forlì and of his two sons."</p>

<p>This, however, did not content Ordelaffo, for with three
hundred of his best horse he followed King Louis to help
him in his undertaking on December 17, 1347.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Now
Ordelaffo was not only a lover of the chase and of war,
but in his way a humanist also, who, like Sigismondo
Malatesta later, surrounded himself with poets and men
of letters. Among his friends and counsellors was that
Cecco da Meleto who was the friend of Petrarch and
Boccaccio.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> He was a great admirer of Petrarch, and
merited the title Boccaccio gave him in that letter to
Zanobi: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pieridum hospes gratissimus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>If that letter is authentic,<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> then Boccaccio not only met
King Louis of Hungary<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> at Forlì, but accompanied him
and Francesco degli Ordelaffi into the Kingdom in the end
of the year 1347 and the beginning of 1348.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> His sentiments
with regard to the murder and the war which
followed it are clearly expressed there. He speaks of
the King's arms as "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">arma justissima</i>," and though it surprises
us to find Boccaccio on that side, the letter only
states clearly the sentiments already set down in allegory
in the third and eighth <cite>Eclogues</cite>, and clearly but more
discreetly stated in the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Casibus Virorum</cite>. In the
fourth <cite>Eclogue</cite>, however, he commiserates the unhappy
fate of Louis of Taranto, and hymns his return. Can it
be that, at first persuaded of the Queen's guilt, he learned
better later? We do not know. The whole affair of the
murder, as of Boccaccio's actions at this time and of his
sentiments with regard to it, are mysterious. If in the
third and eighth <cite>Eclogues</cite> he tells us that Giovanna and
Louis of Taranto were the real murderers of Andrew and
wishes success to the arms of the avenger; in the fourth,
fifth, and sixth <cite>Eclogues</cite> he sympathises with Louis and
tells of the misery of the Kingdom after the descent of the
Hungarians, and at last joyfully celebrates the return of
Giovanna and her husband.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> And this contradiction is
emphasised by his actions. So far as we may follow him
at all in these years, we see him in Naples horrified and
disgusted at the state of affairs, leaving the city after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>torture and death of the Catanesi and repairing to the
courts of the Polenta and of the Ordelaffi, the enemies of
the Church which held Giovanna innocent, and of the
champions of the Church, Robert and Naples. Nor does
he stop there, but apparently follows Ordelaffo in his
descent with King Louis on Naples in the end of 1347
and the beginning of 1348. Yet in 1350 he was in
Naples, and in 1352 he was celebrating the return of
those against whom he had sided and written. The contradiction
is evident, and we cannot explain it; but in a
manner it gives us the reason why, when Frate Martino da
Segna asked for an explanation and key to the <cite>Eclogues</cite>,
he supplied him with one so meagre and imperfect.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>King Louis of Hungary, as we know, had not been
many months in the Kingdom when he was forced to fly
for his life, not by a mortal foe, but by the plague&mdash;the
Black Death of 1348. It was brought to Italy by two
Genoese galleys which had been trading in the East and
had touched at Pisa. In April it had spread to Florence,
a month later to Siena, before Midsummer all Italy was in
its grip, and by the following year the greater part of
Europe. No chronicler of the time in Italy but has more
than enough to say of this "judgment of God"; and
beside the wonderful description by Boccaccio in the
introduction to the <cite>Decameron</cite>, there is scarcely a novelist
who does not recount some tale or other concerning it.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps Tuscany suffered most severely. "In our city of
Florence," writes Matteo Villani,<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> for old Giovanni Villani
perished in the pestilence&mdash;"in our city of Florence the
plague became general in the beginning of April of the
year 1348, and lasted till the beginning of September.
And there died in the city, the <i>contado</i>, and the district,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>of both sexes and of all ages, three out of every five
persons and more, for the poor suffered most, since it
began with them who were utterly without aid, and more
disposed by weakness to be attacked." Already Giovanni
Villani had noted that in 1347 "there began in Florence
and in the <i>contado</i> a sort of sickness which always follows
famine and hunger, and this especially fell on women and
children among the poor."<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Giovanni Morelli<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> tells us
that in Florence it was a common thing to see people
laughing and talking together, and then in the same hour
to see them dead. People fell down dead in the streets, and
were left where they fell. "Many went mad and cast themselves
into wells or out of windows into the Arno by
reason of their great pain and horrible fear. Vast numbers
died unnoticed in their houses, and were left to putrefy
upon their beds. Many were buried before they were
actually dead. Priests went bearing the cross to accompany
a corpse to burial, and before they reached the
church there were three or four biers following them.
The grass grew in the streets. So completely were all
obligations of blood and of affection forgotten, that men
left their nearest and dearest to die alone rather than incur
the danger of infection."<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Nor was this all. Every sort
of moral obligation was forgotten. Boccaccio more than
hints at this, and we have evidence from many others. In
the continual fear of death men and women often forgot
everything but the present moment, which they were content
to enjoy in each other's arms, even though they were
strangers. Ah, poor souls! Amid the terror and loneliness
of the summer, when the hot sunshine was more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>terrible than the darkness, which at least hid the shame,
the disorder, and the visible horror, there was no lack
of opportunities. All social barriers were gone, and rich
and poor, bond and free, took what they might desire. It
was the same in Siena; and if in Naples and the Romagna
the deaths were less numerous, what are a few thousands
when the lowest mortality was more than two in every
five? People said the end of the world was come. In a
sense they were right. It was the end of the Middle
Age.</p>

<p>In Florence there perished among the rest Giovanni
Villani, as I have said, and, as we may believe, Bice, the
second wife of Boccaccino. In Naples it seems certain
that Fiammetta died.</p>

<p>But where was Boccaccio during those dreadful five
months of 1348? Was he with Fiammetta in Naples?
Did he perhaps close her eyes and bear her to the grave?
Or was he in Florence with his father, or in Forlì with
the Ordelaffi? All we know is that he was not in
Florence,<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> and it therefore seems certain that he was either
in Naples, though we cannot say with Fiammetta, or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Forlì with Ordelaffo. Wherever he was, he did not escape
the terrible sights that the plague brought in its train.
He tells us of one of these which he himself had seen in
the Introduction to the <cite>Decameron</cite>. On the whole, however,
it seems likely that Boccaccio was in Naples at this
time, and Baldelli even cites the letter to Franceschino
de' Bardi, which he tells us bears the date of May 15,
1349,<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> and which was certainly written in Naples. Wherever
he may have been, however, he was recalled to
Florence by the death of his father, which befell not in
the plague, for in July, 1348, he added a codicil to his
Will,<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> but between that date and January, 1350, when, as
Manni proved, Giovanni was appointed tutor to his
brother Jacopo.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>In that year, 1350, Boccaccio was thirty-seven years old,
and, save for his stepbrother Jacopo, he was now alone in
the world. His father was dead, his stepbrother Francesco
had long since been in the grave, and now Fiammetta also
was departed. And those last ten years, which had robbed
him of so much, of his youth also, had been among the
most terrible that even Italy can ever have endured. He
had seen Florence run with blood, and every sort of torture
and horror stalk abroad in Naples. Rome, if he ventured
there, can have appeared to him but little less than a
shambles. Rienzi, with all that hope, had come and
vanished like a ghost. The fairest province in Italy lay
under the heel of a barbarian invader. And as though
to add a necessary touch of irony to the tragedy that had
passed before his eyes, he had taken refuge and found such
peace as he enjoyed among the unruly and riotous <i>signorotti</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>and bandits of the Romagna, where properly peace
was never found, but which amid the greater revolutions
on the western side of the Apennines seemed perhaps
peaceful enough. And then had come the pestilence,
which cared nothing for right or wrong, innocent or guilty,
young or old, bond or free, but slew all equally with an
impartial and appalling cruelty that was like a vengeance&mdash;the
vengeance of God, men said. In that vengeance,
whether of God or of outraged nature, all that he loved
or cared for had been lost to him. That he always loved
his mother, dead so long ago, better than his father goes
for nothing; that he loved his father as all men love him
who has given them life is certain, he could not choose but
love him. But in spite of the easy laugh, too like a sneer
to be quite true or sincere, at the beginning of the <cite>Decameron</cite>,
the wound he felt most nearly, that he never
really forgot or quite forgave, was the death of Fiammetta,
whom he had loved at first sight, with all the eagerness
and fire of his youth, with all his heart, as we might say,
ruthlessly keeping nothing back. From this time love
meant nothing to him; there were other women doubtless
in his life, mirages that almost lured him to despair or
distraction, for he was always at the mercy of women;
but the passion, if we may so call it, which henceforth fills
his life is that of friendship&mdash;friendship for a great and a
good man which, with all its comfort, left him still with that
vain shadow, that emptiness in his heart&mdash;</p>

<h2><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>
<p class="pfs90 w-sp">THE <cite>RIME</cite>&mdash;THE SONNETS TO FIAMMETTA</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">Fiammetta</span> was dead. It must have been with
that sorrow in his heart that Boccaccio returned
once more from Naples into Tuscany, to settle
the affairs of his father and to undertake the
guardianship of his stepbrother Jacopo. That the death
of Fiammetta was very bitter to him there are many
passages in his work to bear witness; her death was the
greatest sorrow of his life; yet even as there are persons
who doubt Shakespeare's love for the "dark lady" and
would have it that those sonnets which beyond any other
poems in any literature kindle in us pity and terror
and love are but a literary exercise, so there is a certain
number of professional critics who would deny the reality
of Boccaccio's love for Fiammetta. I confess at once that
with this kind of denial I have no sympathy whatever. It
seems to me the most ridiculous part of an absurd profession.
We are told, for instance, in the year 1904 that Sir
Philip Sidney, who died in 1586, did not love his Stella;
and this is suddenly asserted with the air of a medieval
Pope speaking <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedra</i>, no sort of evidence in support
of the assertion being vouchsafed, and all the evidence
that could be brought to prove the contrary ignored in
a way that is either ignorant or dishonest. Sidney spent
a good part of his life telling us he did love Stella; his best
friend, Edmund Spenser, in two separate poems on his death
asserts in the strongest way he can that this was true; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
all this apparently that some hack in the twentieth century
should find them both liars. Such is "criticism" and
such are the "critics," who do not hesitate to explain
to us as fluently as possible the psychology of a poet's
soul. The whole method both in its practice and in
its results is a fraud, and would be dangerous if it were
not ridiculous.</p>

<p>This very method which in regard to Shakespeare and
Sidney has brought us to absurdity has been applied,
though with some excuse, to Boccaccio in regard to his
love for Fiammetta. It has been necessary, apparently,
to defeat the heresiarchs with their own weapons, to write
pamphlets to prove that Boccaccio's love for Fiammetta was
a real passion<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> and not a figment of his imagination, and
this in spite of the fact that he tells us over and over and over
again almost every detail of that love which was the sunlight
and shadow of his youth, the consolation and the regret
of his manhood and age. Yes, say the dissenters, we must
admit that; but on the other hand you must allow that
Boccaccio carefully wraps everything up in mystery; he
gives us not a single date, and in his own proper person
he says nothing, or almost nothing, about it. Well, there
is some truth in that; but Boccaccio did not write an
autobiography, and if he had, it would scarcely have been
decent then, whatever it may be thought now, to proclaim
himself, actually in so many words with names and dates,
the lover of a married lady, and this would have been
almost impossible if that lady were the daughter of a
king. Thus on the face of it, the last thing we ought
to expect is a frank statement of such facts as
these.</p>

<p>But then, the dissenters continue, none of the contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
biographers, such as Villani and Bandino,<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> say
anything of the matter. Our answer to that is that they
had nothing to say for the same reason that a modern
biographer would have or should have nothing to say in
similar circumstances. But in spite of the diversity of
opinion which we find for these and similar reasons, we
must suppose, that even to-day, to every type of mind and
soul save the critic of literature it must be evident that
the love of Boccaccio for Fiammetta was an absolutely real
thing, so real that it made Boccaccio what he was, and
led him to write those early works which we have
already examined and to compose the majority of the
poems which we are now about to consider and to enjoy.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>But before we proceed to consider in detail these
sonnets and songs of Boccaccio, we must decide which of
all those that from time to time have passed under his
name are really his. And here we will say at once that
no English writer, no foreign writer at all, has a right to
an opinion. Such a question, involving as it does the
subtlest and most delicate rhythm of verse, cannot be
solved by any one who is not an Italian, for to us the most
characteristic and softest music of the Tuscan must ever
pass unheard. So the French have made of Poe a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>great poet because they, being foreigners, can hear, and
not too easily, his melody; while the music of Herrick,
for instance, is too subtle for them in the foreign tongue.
No, for us there remains the received canon of Boccaccio's
<cite>Rime</cite> to which no doubt can attach, and that consists of
one hundred and four sonnets, namely, Nos. 1-101 and 107,
109, and 110 in Baldelli's edition,<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> and a poem which Baldelli
refused to print because he thought it obscene, though
in fact it is not, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Poi, Satiro se' fatto sì severo</i>&mdash;all these
conserved in Prof. Cugnoni's codex of the <cite>Rime</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> We
may add the two <i>ballate</i>, the first <i>madrigale</i>, the <i>capitolo</i> on
the twelve beautiful ladies, and the <i>ballata</i> which Baldelli
mistakenly calls a <i>canzone</i> from the Livorno collection.
To these we may add again four sonnets and a <i>ternario</i>
from the codex Marciana (Venice, it cl. ix. 257), and finally
the madrigal <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">O giustizia Regina</cite> in codex Laurenziana
(Florence, xl. 43).<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>Having thus decided on our text, let us try to get it into
some sort of order. Baldelli's collection, which has been
twice reprinted, is itself an utter confusion,<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> a mere heap
of good things. If we are to make anything of these
poems we must arrange them in some sort of sequence,
either of date or of contents. No one can possibly
arrange them in the order in which they were written, and
therefore, though there are <i>lacunæ</i>, for we cannot suppose
that we are in possession of all Boccaccio's verse, or if we
were that he would consciously have written a story in
sonnets, we shall try to arrange them in accordance with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>their subjects. In this I follow for the most part the work
of the Signori Manicardi and Massera. They were not,
however, the first to try their hands at it. The learned
Signore Antona Traversi<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> had already suggested a method
of grouping these sonnets, when they began to bring a real
order out of chaos.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, Signor Antona Traversi
thought he could distinguish four sonnets which were
written before any of those he wished to give to Fiammetta.
He found seventy-eight which were inspired by her, nine
of which were concerned with her death. Two others he
thought were composed for the widow of the <i>Corbaccio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>The sonnets to Fiammetta, sixty-nine of which were
written to her living and nine to her dead, he arranges in
a sort of categories, thus: twenty-six sonnets he calls
"ideal"&mdash;these were written to her in the first years that
followed Boccaccio's meeting with her; nineteen he calls
"sensual"&mdash;these were composed before he possessed her
at Baia; twenty-three he calls "very sensual"&mdash;these were
written in the fullness of his enjoyment, when his most impetuous
desires had been satisfied. Finally, Signor Antona
Traversi finds one sonnet where we may see his sorrow at
having lost his mistress.</p>

<p>But this method is almost the same as that we found so
absurd in the dissenters, who eagerly deny the reality of
any love which man has cared to express. Its success
depends entirely on our absolute knowledge of the psychology
of man's heart, of a poet's heart. What knowledge,
then, have we which will enable us to divide what is ideal
love here from what is base love, the false from the true?
Is the parable of the tares and the wheat to go for nothing?
And again, can we divide love, the love of any man for
any woman, if indeed it be love, into "sensual," "ideal," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>so forth? Indeed, for such a desperate operation one
would need a knowledge of man beside which that of
Shakespeare would be as a rushlight to the sun. Canst
thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades or loose the
bands of Orion? Who shall divide love into periods of the
soul? These are things too wonderful for me, which I
know not. Are not "idealism" and "sensuality" moods
of the same passion, often simultaneous and always interchangeable?
Or do the critics speak of affection? But I
speak not of affection. I speak of love&mdash;a flame of fire.
And whatever Boccaccio's love may have been, good or
bad as you will, I care not what you decide to think, this
at least it was, a passion, a passion which mastered him
and destroyed in him much that was good, much that was
bad, but that made of him a poet and the greatest story-teller
in the world. Such a passion was composed of an
infinite number of elements spiritual and physical, in which
the sensual presupposes the ideal even as the ideal does
the sensual. Who may divide what God has joined together?
And if one might&mdash;what disaster!</p>

<p>As though this difficulty were not enough to stagger
even the most precise among us, we have to take this
also into account, that for the first time in modern literature,
love, human love, is freely expressed in Boccaccio's
sonnets. It is true Dante had sung of Beatrice till she
vanishes away into a mere symbol, far and far from our
world in the ever-narrowing circles of his Paradise. So
Petrarch had sung of Laura till the coldness of her
smile&mdash;ah! in the sunshine of Provence&mdash;has frozen his song on his
lips, so that it is as smooth and as brittle as ice. It
is not of such as these that Boccaccio sings, but of a
woman mean and lovely, beautiful as the sea and as
treacherous, infinitely various, licentious, sentimental, of
two minds in a single heart's beat, who smiled his soul out
of his body in a short hour on a spring morning in church,
who passed with him for her own pleasure in the shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of the myrtles at Baia, whom he took by the hair, and
kissed cruelly, thirsty for kisses, on the mouth, and who,
being weary, as women will be, threw him aside for no
cause but for this, that she had won his love. No man but
Dante could have loved Beatrice, for he made her; and for
Laura, she is so dim, so mere a ghost, I only know her
name; but for Fiammetta, which of us would not have
staked his eternal good, since in her we recognise the very
truth; not "every woman"&mdash;God forbid&mdash;but woman, and
if, as the dissenters would assert, she is a myth, a creation
of Boccaccio's, then indeed he was an artist only second
to the greatest, for she is only less human, less absolute
than Cleopatra.</p>

<p>We may take it then, first, that Boccaccio's love was a
reality, and not a "literary exercise" that he performed
in these sonnets; and then, that if we are to get any
order at all out of those which deal with so profound and
difficult a subject as love, we must not hope to do it by
dividing them into certain artificial categories, such as of
"ideal love," of "sensual love," of "very sensual love."</p>

<p>Let us begin with certainties. We can dispose of certain
of the poems at once. Sonnet xcvii. to Petrarch, who is
dead, must have been written after July 20, 1374. Sonnets
vii., viii., ix., which deal with certain censures which had
been passed on his Exposition of Dante, were certainly
written after August, 1373, when Boccaccio was appointed
to lecture on the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>. In sonnets i., xxvi.,
xlii., lxiv., lxviii., and xciii. he alludes to the fact that he
is growing old.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> In sonnet ciii. he says he is sorry to
depart without hope of seeing his lady again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verseq"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>"Ma ciò mai non avviene, e me partire</p>
<p class="verse">Or convien contra grado, nè speranza</p>
<p class="verse">Di mai vederti mi rimane alcuna.</p>
<p class="verse">Onde morrommi, caro mio disire,</p>
<p class="verse">E piangerò, il tempo che m' avanza,</p>
<p class="verse">Lontano a te, la mia crudel fortuna."</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If this refers to Fiammetta, as seems certain, it should
have been written in 1340-1. Finally, it is natural to
suppose that the greater part of the sonnets written to
Fiammetta living were composed between 1331 and 1341,
while those to Fiammetta dead were written after 1348.
From these facts I pass on to make the only possible distribution
of the <cite>Rime</cite> that our present knowledge allows.</p>

<p>Let us begin by distinguishing the love poems from the
rest, which for the most part belong to Boccaccio's old age.
There are thirty-two poems which are not concerned with
love, namely, twenty-nine sonnets: Nos. i., vi.-xii., xxvi.-xxviii.,
xxxvi., xlii., xlix., lvi., lxviii., lxxiv., lxxviii., xci.-xcvi.,
xcix., ci., <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Poi Satiro</cite>, <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Saturna al coltivar</cite>, <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allor che
regno</cite>, and to these we may add the <i>capitolo</i>, the <i>ballata</i>
of the beautiful ladies, and the madrigal <cite>O giustizia
regina</cite>.</p>

<p>There are nine, if not eleven, sonnets written <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">in morte
di Madonna Fiammetta</i>: (xix.?), xxi., xxix., li., (lviii.?),
lx., lxvii., lxxiii., lxxxviii., xc., xcviii.</p>

<p>All the rest are love poems. Let us begin with them.
And the first question that must be answered is: Were
they all written to Fiammetta, or were some of them composed
for one or other of the women with whom Boccaccio
from time to time was in relations?</p>

<p>Crescini tells us that it is only just to admit that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>least the greater part of the love poems of Boccaccio refer
to Fiammetta. Landau is more precise, and Antona
Traversi follows him in naming sonnets c. and ci. (the
latter we do not call a love poem) as written for Pampinea
or Abrotonia. To these Antona Traversi adds sonnets xii.
and xvii. (the former we do not call a love poem), which he
thinks were written for one of the ladies Boccaccio loved
before he met Fiammetta.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> I give them both in Rossetti's
translation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse">Their loves. And each had twined a bough to shield</p>
<p class="verse">Her lovely face; and the green leaves did yield</p>
<p class="verse">The golden hair their shadow; while the two</p>
<p class="verse">Sweet colours mingled, both blown lightly through</p>
<p class="verse">With a soft wind for ever stirred and still.</p>
<p class="verse">After a little while one of them said</p>
<p class="verse">(I heard her), 'Think! If, ere the next hour struck,</p>
<p class="verse">Each of our lovers should come here to-day,</p>
<p class="verse">Think you that we should fly or feel afraid?'</p>
<p class="verse">To whom the others answered, 'From such luck</p>
<p class="verse">A girl would be a fool to run away.'"</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>That might seem to be just a thing seen, perfectly expressed,
so that we too feel the enchantment of the summer
day, the stillness and the heat; but if indeed it be written
for any one, it might seem to be rather for the blonde
Fiammetta than for any other lady.</p>

<p>Sonnet xvii., however, is, it seems to me as it seemed to
Rossetti, clearly Fiammetta's. Is it not a reminiscence of
happiness at Baia?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>"Love steered my course, while yet the sun rode high,</p>
<p class="verse">On Scylla's waters to a myrtle grove:</p>
<p class="verse">The heaven was still and the sea did not move;</p>
<p class="verse">Yet now and then a little breeze went by</p>
<p class="verse">Stirring the tops of trees against the sky:</p>
<p class="verse">And then I heard a song as glad as love,</p>
<p class="verse">So sweet that never yet the like thereof</p>
<p class="verse">Was heard in any mortal company.</p>
<p class="verse">'A nymph, a goddess or an angel sings</p>
<p class="verse">Unto herself, within this chosen place,</p>

<p class="verse">And there my lady, 'mid the shadowings</p>
<p class="verse">Of myrtle trees, 'mid flowers and grassy space,</p>
<p class="verse">Singing I saw, with others who sat round."</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Of the rest the following seem to be doubtfully addressed
to Fiammetta:<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Sonnet xxxv. may refer to his abandonment
by Fiammetta; cix. seems to refer to the same misfortune;
lxxxi. was possibly written before he possessed
her; but these two and xlv., lxiv., lxv., and c. seem to
Manicardi and Massera too much of the earth for Fiammetta,
and they regard them as later work. As we
have already said,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> in sonnet lxiv. he speaks of growing
grey.</p>

<p>When we have disposed of these, the rest seem to
belong to Fiammetta. If we would have nothing but
certainties, however, we must distinguish. In lxvii. and lxx.
(the first <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">in morte</i>) her name occurs, while in xl., xli., xlvi.,
lxiii., in the ternaria, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Amor che con sua forza</i> (verse 18), and
the fragment of the sestina, her name is clearly hinted at,
as it probably is in sonnet lxxxiii. (verse 11).<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Again in
iv., xv., xxxiii., lxix., Baia is spoken of; and in xxxiv.,
xlvii., xlviii., Miseno. In v. and lii. Naples is named as
Parthenope; in xxxii. and liii. the scene is on the sea, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>near it in xxxi.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> In sonnet xxxviii. we see him falling in
love:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">While in sonnets iii., xviii., xxiv., xxv., xxx., xl., xli., lxi.
he praises who but Fiammetta:&mdash;</p>

<p>These sonnets were written to Fiammetta before the betrayal,
and to them I would add sonnets xxii. and lxxxvi.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verseq">"Se io potessi creder, che in cinqu' anni ..."</p>

<p class="noindent">which I have already referred to and used in suggesting

possession in Boccaccio's love affair.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>I now turn to the sonnets, which, in their dolorous complaint,
would seem to belong to the period after his
betrayal. In sonnets lxxix. and lxxx. he reproves Love,
in lxx. he swears that love is more than honour, in lvii.
he invokes death as his only refuge, in lxxvii. he burns
with love and rage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verseq">"Ed io, dolente solo, ardo ed incendo</p>
<p class="verse">In tanto fuoco, che quel di Vulcano</p>
<p class="verse">A rispetto non è ch' una favilla."</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>In sonnets iv., v., xliii., lv., and ballata i. he is altogether
desperate. In iv. we have the splendidly bitter invective
against Baia already quoted.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>It is true that we should not have recognised the soul
of Fiammetta as the "chastest that ever was in woman";
but that Boccaccio could think so is not only evidence
that he had been blind, as he says, but also of the eagerness
of his passion. If we had any doubt of the reason of
his misery, however, it is removed by sonnets xliii., lv., and
ballata i., where his betrayal is explicitly mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> In
sonnet xvi. a thousand ways of dying present themselves to
him; in cv. he hopes, how vainly, to win her back again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verseq">"Questa speranza sola ancor mi resta,</p>
<p class="verse">Per la qual vivo, ingagliardisco e tremo</p>
<p class="verse">Dubbiando che la morte non m' invole...."</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>With these sonnets we should compare xxxvii., xxxix.,
xlvi., lxxv., lxxxvii., and ciii. Sonnet lxxxvii. is perhaps
the most beautiful of these poems written in despair: it
has been quoted above.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>In sonnets xiv. and lxxi. he tries to rouse himself, to
free himself, in vain, from love;<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> while in sonnet lxxii. he
likens himself to Prometheus. He bemoans his fortune
again and again in sonnets ii., xxx., lii., cx.; while in
xx. and cvii. he tries to hope in some future. Whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>that future ever came we do not know. There is no hint
of it in the sonnets, and on the whole one is inclined to
think it did not.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> His last sight of Fiammetta, recorded
after her death, we may find in the beautiful sonnet so
marvellously translated by Rossetti:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Round her red garland and her golden hair</p>
<p class="verse">I saw a fire about Fiammetta's head;</p>
<p class="verse">Thence to a little cloud I watched it fade,</p>
<p class="verse">Than silver or than gold more brightly fair;</p>
<p class="verse">And like a pearl that a gold ring doth bear,</p>
<p class="verse">Even so an angel sat therein, who sped</p>
<p class="verse">Alone and glorious throughout heaven, array'd</p>
<p class="verse">In sapphires and in gold that lit the air.</p>
<p class="verse">Then I rejoiced as hoping happy things,</p>
<p class="verse">Who rather should have then discerned how God</p>
<p class="verse">Had haste to make my lady all His own,</p>
<p class="verse">Even as it came to pass. And with these stings</p>
<p class="verse">Of sorrow, and with life's most weary load</p>
<p class="verse">I dwell, who fain would be where she is gone."</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Fiammetta's death is nowhere directly recorded in the
sonnets, but in those which he made for her dead we find,
as we might expect, that much of his bitterness is past,
and instead we have a sweetness and strength as of sorrow
nobly borne. Was not death better than estrangement,
for who will deny anything to God, who robs us all? And
so in that prayer to Dante we have not only the best of
these sonnets, but the noblest too, the strongest and the
most completely human. No one will to-day weep with
Dante for Beatrice, or with Petrarch for Madonna Laura,
but these tears are our own:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>Again in sonnet lxxiii. he sees her before God's throne
among the blessed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">Like Laura, it is true, but more like herself,<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> she visits

All these sonnets were not necessarily or even probably
written immediately after Fiammetta's death. The
thought of her was present with Boccaccio during the
rest of his life,<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> and it is noteworthy and moving that at
the age of sixty-one he should thus address Petrarch dead

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Such was the poet Boccaccio.</p>

<p>In turning now for a moment to look for his masters in
verse, we shall find them at once in Dante and Petrarch.
In his sonnets he followed faithfully the classic scheme,
and only three times did he depart from it, adding a <i>coda</i>
formed of two rhyming hendecasyllabic lines. Nor is he
more original in the subject of his work. Fiammetta is, up
to a certain point, the sister of Beatrice and of Laura, a
more human sister, but she remains always for him la mia
Fiammetta, never passing into a symbol as Beatrice did for
Dante or into a sentiment as Laura for Petrarch.</p>

<p>Finally, in considering his place as a poet, we must
admit that it has suffered by the inevitable comparison of
his work with that of Dante and of Petrarch. Nevertheless,
in his own time the fame of his poems was spread
throughout Italy. Petrarch thought well of them, and
both Bevenuto Rambaldi da Imola and Coluccio Salutati
hailed him as a poet: it was the dearest ambition of his
life and that about which he was most modest. Best of
all, Franco Sacchetti, his only rival as a novelist, if indeed
he has a rival, and a fine and charming poet too, hearing
of his death, wrote these verses:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfs90">1350-1351</p>
<p class="pfs90 w-sp">BOCCACCIO AS AMBASSADOR&mdash;THE MEETING
WITH PETRARCH</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">As</span> we have seen, Boccaccio returned to Florence
probably in the end of 1349. His father, who
was certainly living in July, 1348, for he then
added a codicil to his Will,<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> seems still to
have been alive in May, 1349,<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> but by January, 1350, he is
spoken of as dead and Giovanni is named as one of his
heirs.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> And in the same month of January, 1350, on the
26th of the month, Boccaccio was appointed guardian of
his brother Jacopo,<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> then still a child. But these were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>the only duties which fell to him in that year, which, as it
proved, was to mark a new departure in his life. It is in
1350 that we find him, for the first time as we may think,
acting as ambassador for the Florentine Republic, and it
is in 1350 that he first met Petrarch face to face and
entertained him in his house in Florence.</p>

<p>The condition of Italy at this time was, as may be easily
understood, absolutely anarchical. While Florence and
Naples were still in the throes of revolution and war, the
Visconti of Milan had not been idle. Using every discontent
that could be found in Italy, chiefly of Ghibelline
origin, they were in the way to threaten whatsoever was
left of liberty and independence. In the worst of this confusion
the plague had suddenly appeared in 1348 with the
same result as an earthquake might have caused. Old
landmarks were overthrown, wealth was, as it were, redistributed,
and the whole social condition, often bad
enough, became indescribably confused.</p>

<i>i. The Marquis of Saluzzo, while out hunting, meets with Griselda, a peasant girl, and falls in love; he clothes her in fine things.

</div>

<p>The economical results of that awful catastrophe, not
only for Italy, but for Europe, were not easily defined or
realised anywhere, and least of all perhaps in Italy, where
the conditions of life were so complex. An enormous
displacement of riches had taken place. All those in any
way concerned with the ministration to the sick or the
burial of the dead were, if they survived, greatly enriched;
and among these was such a society as that of the Or San
Michele. But individuals also found themselves suddenly
wealthy: doctors and druggists, undertakers, drapers, and
poulterers, and such, all who had been able to render help
were seemingly benefited, but the farmers and the merchants
were ruined. Something perhaps of the awful
transformation brought about by the plague may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>realised when we consider that, according to Boccaccio,
Florence lost three out of every five<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> of her inhabitants,
that is about 100,000 persons, that at Pisa six out of every
seven died, that Genoa lost 40,000 people, Siena 80,000,
while every one died at Trapani, in Sicily, not a soul
escaping. Old Agnola de Tura, the Sienese historian,
tells us that he buried five of his sons in the same grave,
and this was not extraordinary. The economic result of
such disaster may then be better imagined than described
in detail. No one realised what had happened: it was inconceivable.
Even the governments did not understand
the new position. They saw the needy suddenly rich,
those who had been clothed in rags went in silks and
French fashions, and they came to the conclusion that the
state was suffering from too great wealth: they revived
sumptuary laws, raised taxes, fixed prices, and did, in fact,
no good, but much harm. The problem to be solved was
that of population and the prices of production. The
moral condition was as disastrous as the economic and
left a more lasting scar.</p>

<p>In this helpless and disastrous condition of the major
part of Italy, from which indeed some of the communes
never wholly recovered,<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> we find what in fact we might
have expected, that those who had suffered least threatened
to become dominant. Now, as it happened, of all Italy
upper and lower Milan had escaped most easily, and it
was in fact a domination of Milan that, with Naples in
the grip of the invader and Tuscany almost depopulated,
Florence had to face.</p>

<p>Things came to a head when the Visconti, in October,
1350, possessed themselves of Bologna. In such a case
Florence might have expected help or at least resentment,
one might think, from the Romagna, but the unruly barons
of that region were fighting for their lives and their lordships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>with Duraforte, whom the Pope had sent to bring
them to order. Nor were Venice and Genoa able to render
her aid, for they had entered on a mortal duel and cared
for nothing else. Naples of course was helpless, and
Siena and Perugia, the one stricken almost to death by
the plague, the other confident in her mountain passes,
thought themselves too far for the ambition of Milan.</p>

<p>So Florence faced the enemy alone, and while we admire
her courage we must admit that she had no choice, for she
would never have moved at all, nor in her condition
would she have been justified in moving, but that she
was directly threatened; for with Bologna in the hands of
Milan her northern trade routes were at the mercy of the
enemy. Thus it became necessary before all else to secure
the Apennine passes, and this she foresaw so well that in
February, 1350, she bought Prato from the Queen of
Naples, who held her rights by inheritance from her father,
Charles of Calabria; and not content with this, for Prato was
no use without Pistoia, she tried to seize Pistoia also.
There, however, she was not wholly or at first successful,
but she was allowed to garrison the citadel as well as two
important fortified places after guaranteeing full freedom to
the Pistolese. In the former of these transactions, the
donation of Prato, carried out by Niccolò Acciaiuoli, we
catch a glimpse of Boccaccio, who was present as a witness
in Florence.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>Just before the sale of Bologna to the Visconti we find
Boccaccio in Romagna at Ravenna, whither he had gone
apparently in September, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> on the delicate
and honourable mission entrusted to him by the Society
of Or San Michele, of presenting a gift of ten gold florins
to the daughter of Dante, a nun in the convent of
S. Stefano dell' Uliva in that city. Thence he seems to
have gone as ambassador for the republic to Francesco
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>degli Ordelaffi of Forlì, who was of course already known
to him. This, however, is unfortunately but conjecture.
We know in fact almost nothing of what, for reasons
which will presently appear, I consider to have been
Boccaccio's first embassy. All that we can assert is that
before November 11, 1350, he went as ambassador into
Romagna, and this we know from a document cited by the
Abate Mehus,<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> bearing that date which says, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominus
Johannes Boccacci olim ambasciator transmissus ad partes
Romandioliæ</span>."<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Baldelli tells us<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> without supporting his
assertions by a single document that Boccaccio went three
times as ambassador for the republic into Romagna: first
in the time of Ostasio da Polenta; later in October, 1350;
and again a few months after. The first of these embassies,
that to Ostasio, he bases on Petrarch's letter of
1365, which we have already quoted and used.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> There
Petrarch says: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ortus est Adriæ in litore ea ferme ætate,
nisi fallor, qua tu ibi agebas cum antiquo plagæ illius
Domino ejus avo, qui nunc præsidet</span>." That is to say, he
says to Boccaccio: "Unless I am mistaken, you were on
the shores of the Adriatic in the time of the grandfather
of him who now rules there." He is speaking of Ravenna,
not of Rimini, and quite apart from the fact that he says,
"unless I am mistaken"&mdash;and he may have been mistaken&mdash;there
is no mention there of an embassy, but only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>of a visit, a visit to Ostasio da Polenta, who died in 1346,
and was the grandfather of Guido da Polenta, who ruled
in Ravenna when that letter was written in 1365. We
have already used this letter to prove the date of that visit,
in doing which we are making legitimate use of it, but to
try to prove an embassy from it is to use it improperly.</p>

<p>The second embassy, Baldelli tells us, was to Francesco
degli Ordelaffi, in October, 1350, "after the sale of Bologna
on the 14th of that month." This again is pure conjecture,
the only document which supports it being that
quoted above, discovered by Mehus. We have, however,
reason to suppose that Baldelli may be right here,<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> and
may possibly have been in possession of a document or
documents since lost to us, which unfortunately he has not
quoted or even named. We know at least that Boccaccio
was ambassador in Romagna before November 11, 1350.
Now until late in 1349 we have seen him in Naples, and in
January and February, 1350, in Florence. In October,
1350, we know him to have been in Florence again, for he
there entertained Petrarch, as he did in December. What
was he doing between February and October in that year?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Well, in September he was in Romagna, in Ravenna fulfilling
his mission from the Or San Michele to the daughter
of Dante. It seems likely, therefore, that it was at this
time he was acting as Florentine ambassador at the court
of the Ordelaffi of Forlì.</p>

<p>As to the third embassy of which Baldelli speaks, that
to Bernardino da Polenta "a few months after" the
second, we know nothing of it, and it remains absolutely
in the air&mdash;a mere conjecture.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>Putting aside Baldelli's assertion, we may take it on the
evidence as most probable that Boccaccio was the ambassador
of Florence in Romagna at some time between
March and October, 1350. If we are right in thinking so,
his mission was of very great importance. What Florence
feared, as we have seen, was the growing power of Milan,
and, after the sale of Bologna, the loss of her trade
routes north, and finally perhaps even her liberty.
Already, in the latter part of 1349,<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> she had offered
again and again to mediate between the Pope and
Bologna and Romagna, fearing that in their distraction
Milan would be tempted to interfere for her own ends.
In the first months of 1350 she had written to the Pope, to
Perugia, Siena, and to the Senate of Rome, that they
should send ambassadors to the congress at Arezzo to
form a confederation for their common protection.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> In
September she wrote the Pope more than once explaining
affairs to him; but he had touched Visconti gold, and far
away in Avignon cared nothing and paid but little heed.
The sale of Bologna, however, brought things to a crisis so
far as the policy of Florence was concerned, and having
secured Prato, Pistoia, and the passes, her ambassadors in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>Romagna had apparently induced the Pepoli to replace
Bologna under the protection of the communes of Florence,
Siena, and Perugia, till the Papal army was ready to act.
But the Papal army was not likely to be ready so long as
Visconti was willing to pay,<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> and we find the Pope, while
he thanks Florence effusively, refusing to acknowledge
the claim of the League to protect Bologna. The sale of
Bologna to Milan, its seizure by the Visconti, brought all
the diplomacy of Florence to naught for the moment, and
in another letter, written on November 9, 1350,<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> she
returns once more to plead with the Pope and to point out
to him the danger of the invasions of the Visconti in
Lombardy and in Bologna, which placed in peril not
only the Parte Guelfa, but the territories of the Church
and the Florentine <i>contado</i>. By the time that letter was
written Boccaccio was back in Florence, and it must have
been evident to the Florentines that the Pope had no
intention of giving them any assistance and that they must
look elsewhere for an ally.</p>

<p>That year, so troubled in Italy, incongruous as it may
seem to us, had been proclaimed by the Pope a year of
Jubilee, not without some intention that the Papal coffers
should benefit from the faithful, then eager to express their
piety and their thankfulness for the passing of the plague.
To gain the indulgence of the Jubilee it was necessary to
spend fifteen days in Rome. On April 17, 1350, the
commune of Florence prayed the Papal Legate, partly, no
doubt, on account of the unsettled condition of the City,
and partly, perhaps, that Florence itself might not be long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>without as many citizens as possible, to reduce the term of
fifteen days to eight for all Florentines and for those who
dwelt in the <i>contado</i>.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>Now Petrarch, always a man of sincere piety, and
especially at this time when he was mourning for Laura,
had spent the earlier months of the year in Padua, Parma,
and Verona. On February 14, the feast of S. Valentine,
he had been present at the translation of the body of
S. Anthony of Padua from its first resting-place to the
church just built in its honour&mdash;Il Santo. On June 20
he had taken formal possession of his archdeaconry in
Parma; and so it was not till the beginning of October
that he set out, alone, on pilgrimage for Rome to win the
indulgences of the Jubilee. As it happened, he travelled
by way of Florence, entering that city for the first time
about the middle of the month, and there, as is generally
supposed, for the first time too, he met Boccaccio face to
face.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Petrarch, born in Arezzo on July 20, 1304, was nine
years older than Boccaccio, and differed from him so much
both in intellect and character that the two friends may
almost be said to complement one another. Of a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>noble nature, Petrarch was nevertheless introspective,
jealous of his reputation, and absolutely personal in his
attitude towards life, of which, as his work shows, he was
in many ways so shy. Nor was he without a certain
puritanism which was his weakness as well as his strength.
As a scholar he was at this time, as he always remained,
incomparably Boccaccio's superior. For Boccaccio the
ancient world was a kind of wonder and miracle that had
no relation to himself or to the modern world. But
Petrarch regarded antiquity almost as we do, and, though
necessarily without our knowledge of detail, such as it is,
with a real historic sense&mdash;as a living thing with which it
was possible, though hardly, to hold communion, by which
it was possible to be guided, governed, and taught, a
reality out of which the modern world was born. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text was 'More-ever'">Moreover</ins>,
in 1350, at the time of his meeting with Boccaccio,
Petrarch was indubitably the most renowned poet and
man of letters in Europe. Every one knew his sonnets, and
his incoronation as Laureate on the Capitol had sufficed
in the imagination of the world, quite apart from the
intrinsic and very real value of his work, to set him above
all other poets of his time. He was the Pope's friend, and
was honoured and welcomed in every court in Italy&mdash;at
the court, for instance, of King Robert of Naples, where
he had left so splendid a memory on his way to the triumph
of the Capitol, at the courts of the <i>signorotti</i> of the
Romagna. The youth of Italy had his sonnets by heart;
all women read with envy his praise of Madonna Laura;
the learned reverenced him as the most learned man of
his time and thought him the peer of Virgil and of Cicero.
Nor was the Church behind in an admiration wherein all
the world was agreed, for she saw in the lettered <i>canonico</i>
the glory of the priesthood, and would gladly have led
him forward to the highest honours.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> It was this man,
one of the most famous and as it happened one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the best of the age, that Boccaccio met in Florence
in 1350.</p>

<p>Petrarch himself gives us an account of their first
meeting.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>"In days gone by," he says in a letter to Boccaccio,<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
"I was hurrying across Central Italy in midwinter;
you hastened to greet me, not only with affection, the
message of soul to soul, but in person, impelled by a
wonderful desire to see one you had never yet beheld, but
whom nevertheless you were minded to love. You had
sent before you a piece of beautiful verse, thus showing
me first the aspect of your genius and then of your person.
It was evening and the light was fading, when, returning
from my long exile, I found myself at last within my
native walls. You welcomed me with a courtesy and respect
greater than I merited, recalling the poetic meeting
of Anchises with the king of Arcadia, who, "in the ardour
of youth," longed to speak with the hero and to press his
hand.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Although I did not, like him, stand "above all
others," but rather beneath, your zeal was none the less
ardent. You introduced me, not within the walls of
Pheneus, but into the sacred penetralia of your friendship.
Nor did I present you with a "superb quiver and arrows of
Lycia," but rather with my sincere and unchangeable
affection. While acknowledging my inferiority in many
respects, I will never willingly concede it in this either to
Nisus or to Pythias or to Lælius.&mdash;Farewell."</p>

<p>Thus began a friendship that lasted nearly twenty-five
years. They were, says Filippo Villani, "one soul in two
bodies."</p>

<p>But Petrarch did not remain long in Florence; after a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>few days he hurried on to Rome, whence he wrote to
Boccaccio on his arrival:&mdash;</p>

<p>"... After leaving you I betook myself, as you
know, to Rome, where the year of Jubilee has called&mdash;sinners
that we are&mdash;almost all Christendom. In order
not to be condemned to the burden of travelling alone
I chose some companions for the way; of whom one,
the oldest, by the prestige of his age and his religious
profession, another by his knowledge and talk, others
by their experience of affairs and their kind affection,
seemed likely to sweeten the journey that nevertheless was
very tiring. I took these precautions, which were rather
wise than happy as the event proved, and I went with a
fervent heart, ready to make an end at last of my iniquities.
For, as Horace says, 'I am not ashamed of past
follies, but I should be, if now I did not end them.'<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Fortune,
I hope, has not and will not be able to alter my
resolution in anything...."<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>But as he himself seems to have feared, he was unlucky
that day, for as he passed with his companions up the hillside
out of Bolsena he was kicked badly on the leg by his
companion's horse and came to Rome with difficulty, suffering
great pain all the time he was there. He seems to
have reached the City on November 1, and to have left it
again early in December for Arezzo, his birthplace, where
he was received with extraordinary honour. Thence he
returned to Florence, where he again saw Boccaccio with
his friends Lapo da Castiglionchio and Francescho Nelli,
whose father had been Gonfalonier of Justice and who
himself became Secretary to Niccolò Acciaiuoli when he
was Grand Seneschal of Naples. Nelli was in Holy
Orders and Prior of SS. Apostoli. Lapo was a man of
great learning; he now presented Petrarch with a copy of
the newly discovered <i>Institutions</i> of Quintillian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>In the New Year Petrarch left Florence, and three
months later we find Boccaccio visiting him in Padua as
ambassador for the republic, which, no doubt to his delight
and very probably at his suggestion, wished to offer
the great poet a chair in her new university. For partly
in rivalry with Pisa, partly to attract foreigners and even
new citizens after the plague,<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> the republic had founded
a new university in Florence at the end of 1348, to which,
in May, 1349, Pope Clement VI had conceded all the
privileges and liberties of the universities of Paris and
Bologna. For some reason or another, however, the new
university had not brought to Florence either the fame or
the population she desired. It was therefore a brilliant
and characteristic policy which prompted her to invite the
most famous man of learning of the day to accept a chair
in it; for if Petrarch could have been persuaded to accept
the offer, the university of Florence would have easily
outshone any other then in existence: all Italy and half
Europe might well have flocked thither.</p>

<p>The offer thus made, and if at Boccaccio's suggestion,
then so far as he was concerned in all good faith, was
characteristic in its impudence or astonishing in its generosity
according to the point of view, for it will be remembered
that Florence had banished Petrarch's father
and confiscated his goods and all such property as it
could lay its hands on two years before the birth of his
son in 1302. With him into exile went his young wife.
They found a refuge in the Ghibelline city of Arezzo, where
for this cause Petrarch was born. Even in 1350, the year
in which the poet entered Florence for the first time, the
decree of banishment was in force against him; had he
been less famous, less well protected, he would have been
in peril of his life. As it was, Florence dared not attack
him; nor, seeing the glory he had won, did she wish to do
anything but claim a share in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
It was doubtless this consideration and some remembrance
of her humiliation before the contempt of that
other exile who had died in Ravenna, that prompted
Florence, always so business-like, to try to repair the
wrong she had done to Petrarch. So she decided to
return him in money the value of the property confiscated
from his father, and to send Boccaccio on the delicate
mission of persuading him to accept the offer she now
made him of a chair in her university.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> With a letter then
from the Republic, Boccaccio set out for Padua in the
spring of 1351, meeting Petrarch there, as De Sade tells
us, on April 6, the anniversary of the day of Petrarch's
first meeting with Laura and of her death.</p>

From the picture in the National Gallery by (?) Bernardino Fungai.</i></div>
</div>

<p>The letter which Boccaccio took with him was from the
Prior of the <i>Arti</i>: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reverendo Viro D. Francisco Petrarcha,
Canonico Padoano, Laureato Poetæ, concivi nostro carissimo,
Prior Artium Vexillifer Justitiæ Populi et Communis
Florentiæ</span>. It was very flattering, laudatory, and moving.
It greeted Petrarch as a citizen of Florence, spoke of his
"admirable profession," his "excellent merit in studies,"
his "utter worthiness of the laurel crown," his "most rare
genius which shall be an example to latest posterity,"
etc. etc. etc. Then it spoke of the offer. "No long time
since," it said, "seeing our city deprived of learning and
study, we wisely decided that henceforth the arts must
flourish and ought to be cultivated among us, and that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>would be necessary to introduce studies of every sort into
our city so that by their help our Republic, like Rome of
old, should be glorious above the other cities of Italy and
grow always more happy and more illustrious. Now our
fatherland believes that you are the one and only man by
whom this result can be attained. The Republic prays
you, then, as warmly as it may, to give yourself to these
studies and to make them flourish...." So on and so
forth, quoting Virgil, Sallust, and Cicero, with allusions
to that "immortal work the <cite>Africa</cite> which...."
Boccaccio was to do the rest. "Other things," the letter
ends, "many and of infinitely greater consideration, you
will hear from Giovanni Boccaccio, our citizen, who is sent
to you by special commission...."<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>With this letter in his pocket Boccaccio made his way
to Padua, where, as we know, he was delighted to come,
nor was Petrarch less happy to see him. And when he
returned he bore Petrarch's answer to the Republic:
"Boccaccio, the bearer of your letter and of your commands,
will tell you how I desire to obey you and what
are my projects." No doubt while Boccaccio was with
him, seeing his sincerity, Petrarch felt half inclined to
accept; but he was at all times infirm of purpose. "If I
break my word that I have given to my friends," he
writes,<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> "it is because of the variation of the human
spirit, from which none is exempt except the perfect man.
Uniformity is the mother of boredom, that one can only
avoid by changing one's place." However that may be,
when later in the year he left Padua, it was to return not
to Florence, but to France.</p>

<p>If we know nothing else of this embassy, we know, at
least, that this sojourn in Padua passed pleasantly for
Boccaccio. In a letter written to Petrarch from Ravenna,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>in July, 1353,<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> he reminds his "best master" of his visit.
"I think," he writes, "that you have not forgotten how,
when less than three years ago I came to you in Padua
the ambassador of our Senate, my commission fulfilled, I
remained with you for some days, and how that those days
were all passed in the same way: you gave yourself to
sacred studies, and I, desiring your compositions, copied
them. When the day waned to sunset we left work and
went into your garden, already filled by spring with
flowers and leaves.... Now sitting, now talking, we
passed what remained of the day in placid and delightful
idleness, even till night."</p>

<p>Some of that talk was doubtless given to Letters, but
some too fell, as it could not but do, on politics. For that
letter, so charming in the scene it brings before us of that
garden at nightfall, goes on to speak in a transparent
allegory of the affairs of Italy and of Petrarch's sudden
change of plans, for whereas in 1351 he had promised to
enter the service of Florence and had cursed the Visconti,
when he returned to Italy in 1353, it was with these very
Visconti he had taken shameful service&mdash;with the enemies
of "his own country" Florence, whom he had spurned,
and who in return had repealed the repeal of his banishment
and refrained from returning to him the money value
of his father's possessions. Is it in revenge for this,
Boccaccio asks, that he has taken service with the enemy?
He reproaches him in the subtlest and gentlest way, yet
with an eager patriotism that does him the greatest
honour, representing him to himself even as a third person,
one Sylvanus, who "had been of their company" in
Padua. Yet Boccaccio does not spare him, and though he
loved and revered him beyond any other living man, he
bravely tells him his mind and points out his treachery,
when his country is at stake.</p>

<p>That Sylvanus, it seems&mdash;Petrarch himself really&mdash;had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
lamented bitterly enough the unhappy state of Italy,
neglected by the Emperors and the Popes, and exposed to
the brutality and tyranny of the Archbishop Giovanni
Visconti of Milan. More and more he cursed the tyrants,
and especially the Visconti, and "how eagerly you agreed
with him!... But now," the letter continues,<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> "I have
heard that this Sylvanus is about to enter the service of
those very Visconti, who even now menace his country. I
would not have believed it had not I had a letter from
him in which he tells me it is so himself. Who would
ever have suspected him of so much mobility of character,
or as likely to forswear his own faith out of greediness?
But he has done so perhaps to avenge himself on his
fellow-citizens who have retaken the property of his father,
which they had once returned to him. But what man of
honour, even when he has received a wrong from his
country, would unite himself with her enemies? How
much has Sylvanus mystified and compromised, by these
acts, all his admirers and friends...."</p>

<p>Just here we come upon something noble and firm in
the character of Boccaccio, something of the "nationalism"
too which was to be the great force of the future,
to which Petrarch was less clairvoyant and which Dante
had never perceived at all. The Empire was dead; in
less than a hundred years men were to protest they did
not understand what it meant. The Papacy then too
seemed almost as helpless as it is to-day. Internationalism&mdash;the
latest cry of the modern decadent or dreamer&mdash;was
already a mere ghost frightened and gibbering in the
dawn, and the future lay in the growth of nationalities, in
the variety and freedom of the world, perhaps in the
federation of Italy. Were these the thoughts that
occupied the two pioneers of the modern world on those
spring nights in that garden at Padua?</p>

the Visconti, the venality and indifference of the
Pope, threatened the very liberty of Tuscany, and
though Boccaccio had till now held no permanent
public office in Florence, we have seen him as a witness
to the donation of Prato, as ambassador for the
Republic in Romagna, and as its representative offering
Petrarch a chair in the new university. He was now to
be entrusted with a more delicate and serious mission.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Florence was tired of appealing to the Pope always in
vain and had at last looked for another champion against
the Visconti. Deserted by the Church, at war with the
Visconti, Florence had either to submit or to find a way
out for herself, and with her usual astuteness she hoped to
achieve the latter by calling to her aid the excommunicated
Ludwig. The moment was well chosen. Ludwig was just
reconciled with Charles IV, King of the Romans, the
greatest enemy of his house. He was poor and in need of
money, little loved in his own country, and not indisposed
to try any adventure that offered. So Boccaccio set out.
The letters given to him December 12, 1351, were directed
to Conrad, Duke of Teck, who had already visited Florence
in 1341, and to Ludwig himself.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> We know, however, nothing
personal to Boccaccio with regard to this mission. In fact
save that it was so far successful that Ludwig sent Diapoldo
Katzensteiner to Florence to continue the overtures we
know little about it at all. Katzensteiner's pretensions,
however, proved to be such that the Florentines would not
accept them, and communications were broken off.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> That
was in March, 1352. On May 1 a new project was on
foot. Florence decided to call the prospective Emperor
Charles IV, the grandson of her old enemy Henry VII,
into Italy to her assistance.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>That a Guelf republic should turn for assistance to
the head of the Ghibelline cause seems perhaps more
strange than in fact it was. Guelf and Ghibelline had
become mere names beneath which local jealousies hid
and flourished, caring nothing for the greater but less
real quarrel between Empire and Papacy. Charles,
however, was to fail Florence; for at the last moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>he withdrew from the treaty, fearing to leave Germany;
when he did descend later, things had so far improved
for her that she was anything but glad to see him
especially when she was forced to remember that it
was she who had called him there. After these two
failures Florence was compelled to make terms with the
Visconti at Sarzana in April, 1353, promising not to interfere
in Lombardy or Bologna, while Visconti for his part
undertook not to molest Tuscany.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> But by this treaty the
Visconti gained a recognition of their hold in Bologna
from the only power that wished to dispute it. They
profited too by the peace, extending their dominion in
Northern Italy. In this, though fortune favoured them,
they began to threaten others who had looked on with
composure when they were busy with Tuscany. Among
these were the Venetians, who made an alliance with
Mantua, Verona, Ferrara, and Padua, and were soon trying
to persuade Florence, Siena, and Perugia to join them.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
Nor did they stop there, for in December, 1353, they too
tried to interest Charles IV in Italian affairs. When it
was seen that Charles was likely to listen to the Venetians
the Visconti too sent ambassadors to him, nor was the
Papacy slow to make friends.</p>

<div class="caption">THE PALACE OF THE POPES AT AVIGNON</div>
</div>

<p>In 1352 Clement VI had died, and in his stead Innocent
VI reigned in Avignon. He was determined to
assert his claims in Italy, and especially in the Romagna,
and to this end despatched Cardinal Albornoz, the redoubtable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>Spaniard, to bring the unruly barons of that region
to order. The whole situation was delicate and complicated.
Florence was in a particularly difficult position.
She had called Charles into Italy without the Pope's leave&mdash;she,
the head of the Guelf cause. He had not come.
Now when she no longer wanted him he seemed to be
coming in spite of her and with the Pope's goodwill. She
seems to have doubted the reality of that, as well she
might. Moreover, though she and her allies would have
been glad enough to join the Venetians, the situation was
too complicated for hurried action, especially as a treaty
only two years old bound them not to interfere in Lombardy
and Bologna so long as they were left alone.</p>

<p>Charles's own position can have been not less difficult.
Now that he seemed really eager to enter Italy, both sides
seemed eager for him to do so. Should he enter Italy as
the "Imperatore de' Preti," and so make sure of a coronation,
or descend as the avenger of the imperial claims?
He hesitated. In these circumstances it seemed to the
Florentines that there was but one thing to do&mdash;to inform
themselves of the real intentions of the Pope, and when
these were known, to decide on a course of action.
In these very delicate missions his countrymen again had
recourse to Boccaccio. He set out on April 28, 1354.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
His instructions were to find out whether the Emperor was
coming into Italy with consent of His Holiness, to speak
of the loyalty of Florence to the Holy See, and to protest
her willingness to do whatever the Pope desired. At the
same time he had to obtain at least this, that the Pope
should exert himself to save the honour and independence
of the republic. Again, if the Pope pretended that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>knew nothing of the advent of Charles, but asked the
intentions of Florence in case he should enter Italy,
Boccaccio was instructed to say that he was only sent to
ask the intentions of His Holiness. In any case he was to
return as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The Pope's answer seems to have been far from clear.
Boccaccio returned, but a few months later Dietifeci di
Michele was sent as ambassador to Avignon with almost
the same instructions and with the same object in
view.</p>

<p>Can it be that Florence really did not understand the
situation as we see it, or was that situation in reality very
dangerous to her liberty? It is difficult to understand how
she can have failed to see that the Pope had already won.
It was obvious that he had come to some arrangement with
Charles, which proved to be that the Church would crown
him on condition that he only spent the day of his incoronation
in Rome and respected the sovereignty of the Pope
in the states of the Church. Moreover, if this were not
enough, as Florence knew, the presence of Albornoz in
Romagna had already drawn the teeth of the Visconti so
far as they were dangerous to Tuscany. However, it seems
to have been in considerable fear and perplexity that she
saw Charles enter Padua early in November, 1354. Now if
ever, some thought doubtless, the White Guelf ideal was
to be realised. Among these idealists was, alas, Petrarch,
whose hymn, not long written perhaps, <cite>Italia Mia</cite>, surely
dreamed of quite another king than a German prince.
Boccaccio was, as I think, better advised. In his seventh
Eclogue he mercilessly ridicules Charles, who in fact,
though not maybe in seeming, was the instrument of the
Pope. He entered Italy by the Pope's leave. Padua
received him with honour, but Cane della Scala of Verona
clanged to his gates, and the Visconti with bared teeth
waited to see what he would do. He went to Mantua
and Gonzaga received him well. There he expected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
ambassador of Tuscany, but as the Pope's friend the
Ghibellines knew him not, they smiled bitterly at the
"Priests' Emperor," only Pisa pathetically stretching out
her hands to Cæsar's ghost, while, as claimant of the
imperial title the Guelf republics would have none of him.
Florence need have had no fear, the Church had out-manœuvred
her enemies as in old time.</p>

<p>Charles, however, was not contemptible. Simple German
as he was, he soon grasped the situation. He made friends
in some sort with Visconti, and in this doubtless Petrarch,
who had urged him on, was able to assist him. From
them he received the iron crown, though not indeed at
Monza, but in Milan, in the church of S. Ambrogio, and at
their hands. That must have been a remarkable and
unhappy time for the King of the Romans, in spite of
Petrarch's talk and friendship. Presently he set out for Pisa
and so to Rome, where he received the imperial crown on
April 4, 1355, and, returning to Pisa, as though in irony
of Petrarch's enthusiastic politics, crowned the grammarian
Zanobi da Strada poet laureate. Yet this was surely but
a German joke. As for Florence, still trembling it seems,
she took as firm a stand as she could, and asked only the
protection and friendship of the Emperor, offering no
homage or subordination. The Sienese, on the other hand,
in spite of their treaty with Florence, offered him their lordship.
Others followed their example, and Pisa was filled
with Ghibellines claiming the destruction of Florence, the
head and front of the Guelf faction. Charles, however,
refused to adventure. He demanded from Florence only
money, as a fine, by paying which she was to be restored
to his favour, and that her magistrates should be called
Vicars of the Empire. She forfeited nothing of her liberty
and none of her privileges as a free republic. Yet at
first she refused to acquiesce. It was only after an infinite
number of explanations that she was brought to consent.
Indeed, we read that the "very notary who read out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
deed broke down, and the Senate was so affected that it
dissolved. On the next day the Act was rejected seven
times before it was passed. The bells were the only
merry folk in Florence, so jealous were her citizens of the
liberty of their state."</p>

<p class="pfs90 w-sp">BOCCACCIO'S ATTITUDE TO WOMAN&mdash;<br />
THE <cite>CORBACCIO</cite></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">Those</span> embassies, for the most part so unsuccessful
one may think, which from time to
time between 1350 and 1354 Boccaccio had
undertaken at the request of the Florentine
Republic, heavy though his responsibility must have been
in the conduct of them, had by no means filled all his
time or seriously prevented the work, far more important
as it proved to be, which he had chosen as the business of
his life. Between 1348 and 1353, as we shall see, he had
written the <cite>Decameron</cite>; in 1354-5 he seems to have produced
the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>, and not much later the <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita di Dante</cite>;
while in the complete retirement from political life, from
the office of ambassador at any rate, which followed the
embassy of 1354 and lasted for eleven years, till indeed
in 1365 he went again to Avignon on business of the Republic,
he devoted himself almost entirely to study and to
the writing of those Latin works of learning which his
contemporaries appreciated so highly and which we have
perhaps been ready too easily to forget.</p>

<p>It is generally allowed<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> that Boccaccio began the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
<cite>Decameron</cite> in 1348, but that it did not see the light in its
completeness till 1353, and this would seem reasonable,
for it is surely impossible that such a work can have been
written in much less than four years. That a considerable
time did in fact divide the beginning from the completion
of the book Boccaccio himself tells us in the conclusion,
at the end of the work of the Tenth Day, where he says:
"Though now I approach the end of my labours, it is
long since I began to write, yet I am not oblivious that it
was to none but to ladies of leisure that I offered my
work...."</p>

<p>That the <cite>Decameron</cite> was not begun before 1348 would
seem to be certain, for even if we take away the Prologue,
the form itself is built on the dreadful catastrophe of the
Black Death.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> If the book was begun between that year
and 1351, it cannot, however, have been suggested, as some
have thought, by Queen Giovanna of Naples, for she was
then in Avignon. In 1348 Boccaccio was thirty-five years
old, and whether at that time he was in Naples or in Forlì
with Ordelaffo is, as we have seen, doubtful, though that he
was in Naples would appear more likely; but wherever he
was he had ample opportunity of witnessing the appalling
ravages of the pestilence which he so admirably describes,
and which is the contrast of and the excuse for his book, for
save in Lombardy and Rome the pestilence was universal
throughout Italy. In 1353, however, we know him to have
been resident in Florence, and if we accept the tradition,
which there is no reason at all to doubt, it was in that year
that the complete <cite>Decameron</cite> first saw the light.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> It was
known, however, in part, long before that, and would seem
indeed to have been published&mdash;if one may so express
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>it&mdash;in parts; not perhaps ten stories at a time&mdash;a day at
a time&mdash;as Foscolo<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> has conjectured, but certainly in
parts, most likely of various quantity and at different
intervals. This would seem to be obvious from the introduction
to the Fourth Day, where Boccaccio speaks of the
envy and criticism that "these little stories" had excited,
and proceeds to answer his detractors. It is obvious that
he could not at the beginning of the Fourth Day have
answered criticisms of his work if some of it had not
already seen the light and been widely read.</p>

<p>It must have been then when he was about forty years
old that he finished the <cite>Decameron</cite>, that extraordinary
impersonal work in which in the strongest contrast with
his other books he has almost completely hidden himself
from us. He might seem at last in those gay, licentious,
and profoundly secular pages, often so delightfully satirical
and always so full of common sense, so sane as we might
say, to have lost himself in a joyous contemplation and
understanding of the world in which he lived, to have
forgotten himself in a love of it.</p>

<p>I speak fully of the <cite>Decameron</cite> elsewhere, and have
indeed only mentioned it here for two reasons&mdash;to fix its
date in the story of his life, and to contrast it and its mood
with the work which immediately followed it, the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>
and the <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita di Dante</cite>.</p>

<p>We cannot, I think, remind ourselves too often in our attempts&mdash;and
after all they can never be more than attempts&mdash;to
understand the development of Boccaccio's mind, of
his soul even, that he had but one really profound passion
in his life, his love for Fiammetta. And as that had
been one of those strong and persistent sensual passions
which are among the strangest and bitterest things in the
world,<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> his passing love affairs&mdash;and doubtless they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>not few&mdash;with other women had seemed scarcely worth
recounting.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> That he never forgot Fiammetta, that he
never freed himself from her remembrance, are among the
few things concerning his spiritual life which we may
assert with a real confidence. It is true that in the Proem
to the <cite>Decameron</cite> he would have it otherwise, but who
will believe him? There he says&mdash;let us note as we read
that even here he cannot but return to it&mdash;that: "It is
human to have compassion on the afflicted; and as it
shows very well in all, so it is especially demanded of
those who have had need of comfort and have found it in
others: among whom, if any had ever need thereof or
found it precious or delectable, I may be numbered;
seeing that from my early youth <i>even to the present</i>,<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
I was beyond measure aflame with a most aspiring
and noble love, more perhaps than were I to enlarge
upon it would seem to accord with my lowly condition.
Whereby, among people of discernment to
whose knowledge it had come, I had much praise and
high esteem, but nevertheless extreme discomfort and
suffering, not indeed by reason of cruelty on the part of
the beloved lady, but through superabundant ardour
engendered in the soul by ill-bridled desire; the which,
as it allowed me no reasonable period of quiescence,
frequently occasioned me an inordinate distress. In which
distress so much relief was afforded me by the delectable
discourse of a friend and his commendable consolations
that I entertain a very solid conviction that I owe it to him
that I am not dead. But as it pleased Him who, being
infinite, has assigned by immutable law an end to all
things mundane, my love, beyond all other fervent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>neither to be broken nor bent by any force of determination,
or counsel of prudence, or fear of manifest shame or
ensuing danger, did nevertheless in course of time abate
of its own accord, in such wise that it has now left naught
of itself in my mind but that pleasure which it is wont
to afford to him who does not adventure too far out in
navigating its deep seas; so that, whereas it was used to
be grievous, now, all discomfort being done away, I find
that which remains to be delightful ... now I may call
myself free."</p>

<p>His love is not dead, but is no longer the sensual agony,
the spiritual anguish it had once been, but it "remains to
be delightful." That it remained, though perhaps not
always "to be delightful," that it remained, is certain.
For though he "may now call myself free," that Proem
tells us that after all we owe the <cite>Decameron</cite> itself indirectly
to Fiammetta. And who reading those tales can believe
in his vaunted emancipation, if by that is meant his
forgetfulness of her? She lives everywhere in those
wonderful pages. Is she not one of the seven ladies of
the <cite>Decameron</cite>? That is true, it will be said, but she has
no personality there, she is but one of ten protagonists
who are without life and individuality. Let it be granted.
But whereas the others are in fact but lay figures, she,
Fiammetta, though she remains just an idol if you will,
is to be worshipped, is to be decked out with the finest
words, to be honoured and glorified. Her name scarcely
occurs but he praises her; he is always describing
her; while for the others he seldom spares a word. Who
can tell us what Pampinea, Filomena, Emilia, Neifile, or
Elisa were like? But for Fiammetta&mdash;he tells us everything;
and when, as in the Proem we have just discussed
or in the Conclusion to the Fourth Day, he speaks for
himself, it is her he praises, it is of her he writes. She
is there crowned as queen. It is Filostrato who crowns her:
"taking the laurel wreath from his own head, and while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>the ladies watched to see to whom he would give it, set it
graciously upon the blonde head of Fiammetta, saying:
'Herewith I crown thee, as deeming that thou, better than
any other, will know how to make to-morrow console our
fair companions for the rude trials of to-day.' Fiammetta,
whose wavy tresses fell in a flood of gold over her
white and delicate shoulders, whose softly rounded face
was all radiant with the very tints of the white lily
blended with the red of the rose, who carried two eyes in
her head that matched those of the peregrine falcon,
while her tiny sweet mouth showed a pair of lips that
shone as rubies...."</p>

<p>And it is the same with the Conclusion of the book,
which in fact closes with her name, and with the question
Boccaccio must have asked her living and dead his whole
life long: "Madonna, who is he that you love?"</p>

<p>That he never forgot her, then, is certain; but Fiammetta
was dead, and for Boccaccio more than for any
other man of letters perhaps, love with its extraordinary
bracing of the intellect as well as of the body was in some
sort a necessity. Never, as we may think, handsome, in
1353, at forty years of age, he was already past his best,
fat and heavy and grey-haired. The death of Fiammetta,
his love affair with her, had left him with a curious fear of
marriage, ill-disguised and very characteristic. If he had
ever believed in the perfection of woman in the way of
Dante and Petrarch and the prophets of romantic
love&mdash;and without thereby damning him it is permissible to
doubt this&mdash;he had long ceased to hold any such creed or
to deceive himself about them. Woman in the abstract
was for him the prize of life; he desired her not as a
friend, but as the most exquisite instrument of pleasure,
beyond the music of flutes or the advent of spring. In
the <cite>Decameron</cite>, though we are not justified in interpreting
all the sentiments and opinions there expressed as necessarily
his own, the evidence is too strong to be put altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
aside. He loves women and would pleasure them,
but he is a sceptic in regard to them; he treats them
always with an easy, tolerant, and familiar condescension,
sometimes petulant, often ironical, always exquisite in its
pathos and humanity; but beneath all this&mdash;let us confess
it at once&mdash;there is a certain brutality that is perhaps the
complement to Petrarch's sentiment. "The Muses are
ladies," he says,<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> speaking in his own person&mdash;he had, as
we have seen, been accused of being too fond of them&mdash;"and
albeit ladies are not the peers of the Muses, yet they
have their outward semblance, for which cause, if for no
other, it is reasonable that I should be fond of them.
Besides which ladies have been to me the occasion of
composing some thousand verses, but of never a verse that
I made were the Muses the occasion."</p>

<p>He loves women then, but he is not deluded by them&mdash;or
rather, as we should say, because he loves them he does
not therefore respect them also. He considers them as
fair or unfair, or as he himself has it,<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> "fair and fit for
amorous dalliance" or "spotted lizards." He does not
believe in them or their virtue&mdash;their sexual virtue that
is&mdash;nor does he value it very highly.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> It is a thing for
priests and nuns, and even there rare enough. But in the
world&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>In one place in the <cite>Decameron</cite><a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> he speaks of the "insensate
folly of those who delude themselves ... with the
vain imagination that, while they go about the world,
taking their pleasure now of this, now of the other woman,
their wives, left at home, suffer not their hearts to stray
from their girdles, as if we who are born of them and live
among them could be ignorant of the bent of their desires."
Moreover, he considers that "a woman who indulges herself
in the intimate use with a man commits but a sin of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>nature; but if she rob him or slay him or drive him into
exile, her sin proceeds from depravity of spirit." Thus, as
the story shows, to deny him the satisfaction of his desire
would be a greater sin than to accord it to him.</p>

<p>Again, in another tale,<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> we see his insistence upon what
he considers&mdash;and not certainly without reason&mdash;as the
reality of things, to deny which would be not merely
useless, but even ridiculous. Certain "very great merchants
of Italy, met in Paris," are "discussing their wives at
home...."<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> "I cannot answer for my wife," says one,
"but I own that whenever a girl that is to my mind comes
in my way, I give the go-by to the love I bear my wife
and take my pleasure of the new-comer to the best of my
power." "And so do I," said another, "because I know
that whether I suspect her or no my wife tries her fortune,
and so it is 'do as you are done by.'" All agree save a
Genoese, who stakes everything on his wife's virtue. He
proves right, his wife is virtuous; but the whole company
is incredulous, and when one of them tells him he is talking
nonsense, and that the general opinion of women's
virtue "is only what common sense dictates," he carries the
whole company with him. He admits that "doubtless few
[women] would be found to indulge in casual amours if
every time they did so a horn grew out on the brow to
attest the fact; but not only does no horn make its appearance,
but not so much as a trace or vestige of a horn, so
only they be prudent; and the shame and dishonour consist
only in the discovery; wherefore if they can do it
secretly they do it, or are fools to refrain. Hold it for
certain that she alone is chaste who either had never
a suit made to her, or suing herself was repulsed. And
albeit I know that for reasons true and founded in nature
this must needs be, yet I should not speak so positively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>thereof as I do had I not many a time with many a woman
verified it by experience."</p>

<p>It is not that in the <cite>Decameron</cite> virtue is not often rewarded
in the orthodox way, but that such cases are not
to the point; they are as unreal, as merely poetical or
fictional as they are to-day. But where real life is dealt
with&mdash;and in no other book of the fourteenth century is
there so much reality&mdash;the evidence is what we have
seen. It was not that woman as we see her there is
basely vicious; but that she is altogether without ideality,
light-hearted and complacent, easily yielding to caprice,
to the allure of pleasure, to the first solicitation that
comes to her in a propitious hour, and this rather because
of a certain <i>gaminerie</i>, a lightness, an incorrigible
naughtiness, than because of a real depravity. Like all
Italians&mdash;the great exceptions only prove the rule&mdash;she
is without a fundamental moral sense. She sins lightly,
easily, without regret, dazzled by life, by the pleasure
of life.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the attitude of Boccaccio towards woman
at the time when he was writing the <cite>Decameron</cite>, that is to
say, from his thirty-fifth to his fortieth year. And we
may well ask whether he had always thought as he did
then, and if not, what had been the cause of his disillusion
and what was to be the result of it?</p>

<p>It is difficult to answer the first of these questions with
any certainty. And yet it might seem incredible that in
his youth he had already emancipated himself from an
illusion&mdash;if illusion it be&mdash;that seems proper to it in all
ages, and that was so universal in the Middle Age as
to inform the greater part of its secular literature&mdash;the
illusion that woman was something to be worshipped,
something almost sacred, to be approached in great
humility, with gentleness and reverence.</p>

<p>In reading the early romances of Boccaccio, it must be
confessed that while his attitude towards woman is not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
assured, nor so masterful in its realism and humour as
in the <cite>Decameron</cite>, it is nevertheless much the same in
character. In the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, as in the <cite>Ameto</cite>, he thinks of
her always as a prize, as something to be hunted or cajoled,
yes, like a barbarian; nor are his early works less sensual
than the <cite>Decameron</cite>. The physical reality is for him&mdash;and
not only in regard to woman&mdash;so much more than the
spiritual.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of the general character of his work, we
observe from time to time, and more especially in the
<cite>Rime</cite>, a certain idealism, still eagerly physical, if you will,
but none the less ideal on that account, which centres in
Fiammetta and his thoughts concerning her.</p>

<p>We have already traced that story from its beginning to
its end, we shall but return to it here to repeat that whatever
we may come to think of it, this at least is assured
and certain: that it was a genuine and sincere passion in
which Boccaccio's whole being was involved&mdash;inextricably
involved&mdash;soul as well as body. To a nature such as
Boccaccio's, so lively and full of energy, that awakening, so
far as his physical nature was concerned, came not without
preparation&mdash;he had had other loves before he saw Fiammetta&mdash;but
spiritually it seems to have been in the nature
of an unexpected revelation. It made him a poet, as we
have seen, and one cannot read the <cite>Rime</cite> without being
convinced that something more was involved in his love
for his lady than the body.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, that we have here under our hands
a history, logical and inevitable, developed by the character
of the man in the circumstances which befell him.
Like all the men of his day, he was in love with love.
Without the profound spiritual energy of Dante, but with
a physical vitality greater far than Petrarch's, Boccaccio
was inevitably in youth at the mercy of the lust of
the eye, following woman because she was beautiful and
because he desired her with all the fresh energy of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
nature. He met Fiammetta and loved her. And then,
though his desire abated no jot, there was added to it a
certain idealism in which to some extent, sometimes
greater, sometimes less, the spirit was involved to his joy
and his sorrow. So, when Fiammetta forsook him, she
wounded him not only in his pride, but in his soul, a wound
that might never altogether be healed. That at least
might seem certain, for had he loved her only as he had
loved the others, to forget her would have been easy; but
he could not forget.</p>

<p>Well, this wound, as we might say, grew angry and
festered, poisoning his whole being with its bitterness.
Thus in the years which follow his betrayal by Fiammetta
we see him regarding woman now with a furious bitterness
and anger, as in the subtle cruelty of the <cite>Fiammetta</cite>,
now merely sensually as the instrument and means of the
pleasure of man&mdash;a flower to be plucked in the garden of
life, worn a little and thrown away e'er one grow weary
of it.</p>

<p>But this phase, mixed of too bitter and too sweet, unhealthy
too and without the capacity of laughter, presently
passed away before the essential virility and energy
of his nature. In the fullness of his youth from thirty-three
to forty, busy with important work, engaged in
responsible missions, the friend of great men of action as
well as of poets and scholars, almost all that bitterness
and anger passes away from him, and instead he assumes
the pose we see in the <cite>Decameron</cite>, to which all his knowledge
of the world, his tolerance of life, his sense of
humour, and in some sort his sanity, must have urged
him. He has lost every illusion with regard to woman
save that she is able to give him pleasure. He may "call
himself free" from her, he says, and he shows her to us,
well, as the realist sees her, as she appears, that is, to the
bodily eye, and as we find her in the <cite>Decameron</cite>.</p>

<p>Let it be granted if you will that such an attitude as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that of the poets of romantic love was ridiculous, and that
like all illusion and untruth it entailed in some sort a
denial of life and brought its own penalty. But was
Boccaccio's attitude really, fundamentally any nearer the
truth? And if not, must not it too be paid for? Assuredly.
Life will not be denied. If woman be nothing but the
flesh, however we may glorify her, she is but dust, and
our mouth, eloquent with her praises, full of ashes. So
it was with Boccaccio. All his early works, including the
<cite>Decameron</cite>, had been written to please women. In the
<cite>Corbaccio</cite> we see the reaction.</p>

<p>It seems that during the time he was writing the
<cite>Decameron</cite>, towards his forty-first year, he found himself
taken by a very beautiful woman, a widow, who pretended
to encourage him, perhaps because of his fame, provoked
his advances, allured him to write to her, and then laughing
at this middle-aged and obese lover, gave his letters to
her young lover, who scattered them about Florence.</p>

<p>Boccaccio had already been hurt, as we have seen, by
the criticisms some had offered on his work.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> This deception
by the widow exasperated him, his love for
women turned to loathing, and he now composed a sort
of invective against them, which was called the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>,
though whether he so named it himself remains unknown.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>The story is as follows: A lover finds himself lost in
the forest of love, and is delivered by a spirit. The lover
is Boccaccio, the spirit is the husband of the widow who
has returned from hell, where his avarice and complaisance
have brought him. In setting Boccaccio in the right way,
the spirit of the husband reveals to him all the imperfections,
artifices and defects, the hidden vices and weaknesses
of his wife with the same brutality and grossness
that Ovid had employed in his <cite>Amoris Remedia</cite>. "Had
you seen her first thing in the morning with her night-cap
on, squatting before the fire, coughing and spitting....
Ah, if I could tell you how many different ways she had
of dealing with that golden hair of hers, you would be
amazed. Why, she spent all her time treating it with
herbs and washing it with the blood of all sorts of animals.
The house was full of distillations, little furnaces, oil cups,
retorts, and such litter. There wasn't an apothecary in
Florence or a gardener in the environs who wasn't ordered
to send her fluid silver or wild weeds...."</p>

<p>Such was Boccaccio's revenge. But he was not content
with this fierce attack on the foolish woman who had
deceived him; he involved the whole sex in his contempt
and ridicule. "Women," he says, "have no other occupation
but in making themselves appear beautiful and in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>winning admiration; ... all are inconstant and light,
willing and unwilling in the same heart's beat, unless
what they wish happens to minister to their incorrigible
vices. They only come into their husband's house to
upset everything, to spend his money, to quarrel day and
night with the servants or with his brothers and relations
and children. They make out that they are timid and
fearful, so that if they are in a lofty place they complain
of vertigo, if in a boat their delicate stomachs are upset,
if we must journey by night they fear to meet ghosts,
if the wind rattles the window or they hear a pebble fall
they tremble with fright; while, as you know, if one tries
to do anything, to go anywhere without warning them,
they are utterly contrary. But God only knows how bold
and how ready they are in things to their taste. There is
no place so difficult, precipices among the mountains, the
highest palace walls, or the darkest night, that will stop
them. Their sole thought, their only object, there one
ambition is to rob, to rule, and to deceive their husbands,
and for this end they will stoop to anything."<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Corbaccio</cite>, however, was not the only work in which
his pessimism and hatred of woman showed itself. It is
visible also in the <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita di Dante</cite>, which was written about
this time or a little later than the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> perhaps in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>1356-7. All goes well till we come to Dante's marriage,
when there follows a magnificent piece of invective which,
while it expresses admirably Boccaccio's mood and helps us
to date the book, has little or nothing to do with Dante.
Indeed, we seem to learn there, reading a little between
the lines, more of Boccaccio himself than of the husband
of Gemma Donati.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>"Oh, ye blind souls," he writes there,<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> "oh ye clouded
intellects, oh, ye vain purposes of so many mortals, how
counter to your intentions in full many a thing are the
results that follow;&mdash;and for the most part not without
reason! What man would take another who felt excessive
heat in the sweet air of Italy to the burning sands of
Lybia to cool himself, or from the Isle of Cyprus to the
eternal shades of the Rhodopæan mountains to find
warmth? What physician would set about expelling acute
fever by means of fire, or a chill in the marrow of the bones
with ice or with snow? Of a surety not one; unless it be
he who shall think to mitigate the tribulations of love by
giving one a bride. They who look to accomplish this
thing know not the nature of love, nor how it maketh
every other passion feed its own. In vain are succours or
counsels brought up against its might, if it have taken firm
root in the heart of him who long hath loved. Even as in
the beginning every feeblest resistance is of avail, so when
it hath gathered head, even the stoutest are wont many
times to turn to hurt. But returning to our matter, and
conceding for the moment that there may (so far as that
goes) be things which have the power to make men forget
the pains of love, what hath he done who to draw out of
one grievous thought hath plunged me into a thousand
greater and more grievous? Verily naught else save by
addition of that ill which he hath wrought me, to bring me
into a longing for return into that from which he hath
drawn me. And this we see come to pass to the most of
those who in their blindness marry that they may escape
from sorrows, or are induced to marry by others who would
draw them hence; nor do they perceive that they have
issued out of one tangle into a thousand, until the event
brings experience, but without power to turn back howsoever
they repent. His relatives and friends gave Dante<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
a wife that his tears for Beatrice might have an end; but
I know not whether for this (though the tears passed away,
or rather perhaps had already passed) the amorous flame
departed; yet I do not think it. But even granted that it
were quenched, many fresh burdens, yet more grievous,
might take its place. He had been wont, keeping vigil at
his sacred studies, to discourse whensoever he would with
emperors, with kings, with all other most exalted princes,
to dispute with philosophers, to delight himself with most
pleasing poets and giving heed to the anguish of others to
mitigate his own.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Now he may be with these only so
much as his new lady chooses; and what seasons it is her
will shall be withdrawn from so illustrious companionship,
he must bestow on female chatter, which, if he will not
increase his woes, he must not only endure but must extol.
He who was wont, when weary of the vulgar herd, to withdraw
into some solitary place, and there consider in his
speculations what spirit moveth the heaven, whence cometh
life to the animals that are on earth, what are the causes
of things; or to rehearse some rare invention, compose
some poem which shall make him though dead yet live
by fame amongst the folk that are to come; must now
not only leave these sweet contemplations as often as the
whim seizes his new lady, but must submit to company
that ill sorts with such like things. He, who was wont to
laugh, to weep, to sing, to sigh, at his will, as sweet or
bitter emotions pierced him, now dares it not; for he
must needs render an account to his lady, not only of
greater affairs, but of every little sigh, explaining what
started it, whence it came, and whither it tended; for she
takes gladness as evidence of love for another, and sadness
as hatred of herself.</p>

<p>"Oh weariness beyond conception of having to live and
hold intercourse, and finally grow old and die with so suspicious
an animal! I choose not to say aught of the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and most grievous cares which they who are not used to
them must bear, and especially in our city; I mean how to
provide for clothes, ornaments, and rooms crammed with
superfluities that women make themselves believe are a
support to an elegant existence; how to provide for man
and maid servants, nurses and chambermaids ... I
speak not of these ... but rather come to certain things
from which there is no escape.</p>

<p>"Who doubts that judgment will be passed by the
general whether his wife be fair or no? And if she
be reputed fair, who doubts but she will straightway
have a crowd of lovers who will most pertinaciously
besiege her unstable mind, one with his good works
and one with his noble birth and one with marvellous
flattery and one with gifts and one with pleasant ways?
And that which many desire shall scarce be defended
against every one; and women's chastity need only once
be overtaken to make them infamous and their husbands
miserable in perpetuity. But if, by misfortune of him
who brings her home, she be foul to look upon&mdash;well,
it is plain to see that even of the fairest women men
often and quickly grow weary, and what are we then
to think of the others, save that not only they themselves,
but every place which they are like to be found of
them who must have them for ever with them, will be
detested? And hence springs up their wrath; nor is there
any wild beast more cruel than an angry woman&mdash;no, nor
so much. Nor may any man live in safety of his life who
hath committed him to any woman who thinketh she hath
good cause to be in wrath against him. And they all
think it.</p>

<p>"What shall I say of their ways? Would I show how
greatly they all run counter to the peace and repose of
men, I must draw out my discourse to an all too long
harangue; and therefore let me be content to speak of
one common to almost all. They imagine that any sorriest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
menial can keep his place in the house by behaving well,
but will be cast out for the contrary. Wherefore they hold
that if they themselves behave well theirs is no better than a
servile lot; for they only feel that they are ladies when they
do ill, but come not to the evil end that servants would.</p>

<p>"Why should I go on pointing out that which all the
world knows? I judge it better to hold my tongue, than
by my speech to give offence to lovely woman. Who
doth not know that trial is first made by him who should
buy ere he take to himself any other thing save only his
wife&mdash;lest she should displease him or ever he have her
home? Whoso taketh her must needs have her not such
as he would choose, but such as fortune yieldeth her to
him. And if these things above be true (as he knoweth
who hath tried) we may think what woes those chambers
hide, which from outside to whoso hath not eyes whose
keenness can pierce through walls, are reputed places of
delight.</p>

<p>"Assuredly I do not affirm that these things chanced to
Dante; for I do not know it: though true it is that (whether
such like things or others were the cause) when once he
had parted from her (who had been given him as a consolation
in his sufferings!) never would he go where she
was, nor suffered he her to come where he was, albeit he
was the father of several children by her. But let not any
suppose that from the things said above I would conclude
that men ought not to take to themselves wives. Contrariwise,
I much commend it; but not for every one. Let
philosophers leave marrying to wealthy fools, to noblemen
and peasants; and let them take their delight with philosophy,
who is a far better bride than any other."</p>

<p>Such then was Boccaccio's mood, "his state of soul" in
the years between 1354 and 1357. Well might Petrarch
discern in him "a troubled spirit": "from many letters of
yours," he writes from Milan on December 20, 1355, "I
have extracted one thing, that you have a troubled spirit."</p>

<p class="pfs90">1357-1363</p>
<p class="pfs90 w-sp">LEON PILATUS AND THE TRANSLATION OF HOMER&mdash;<br />
THE CONVERSION OF BOCCACCIO</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">That</span> a profound change had already taken
place in Boccaccio's point of view, in his
attitude towards life, in his whole moral consciousness,
it might seem impossible to doubt
after reading the <cite>Corbaccio</cite> and the <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita di Dante</cite>; but
though its full significance only became apparent some
years after the publication of those works, the curious
psychologist may perhaps find signs of it before the year
1355. For while that change was on the one hand the
inevitable consequence of his youth and early manhood,
a development from causes that had always been hidden
in his soul, it was also a result, as it was a sign, of his
age, of his passing from youth to middle age, and it
declares itself with the first grey hairs, the first sign of
failing powers and loss of activity, in a sort of disillusion
and pessimism. From this time his life was to be a kind
of looking backward, with a wild regret for the mistakes and
wasted opportunities then perhaps for the first time horribly
visible.</p>

<p>Yes, a part at least of that bitterness, scorn, and anger
against woman might seem to be but the approach of
old age. But side by side with that moral and spiritual
revolution that by no means reached its crisis in 1355, we
may see an intellectual change not less profound, that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
its own way too is also a "looking backward." His
creative powers were paralysed. The <cite>Corbaccio</cite> is the last
original or "creative" work that he achieved; henceforth
his life was to be devoted to scholarship and to criticism,
and however eager we may be to acknowledge the debt
we owe him for his labours in those fields, we cannot but
admit that they are a sign of failing power, of a lost grip
on life, on reality; and though we can hardly have hoped
for another <cite>Decameron</cite>, we are forced to allow that the
energy which created the one we have was of quite
another and a higher sort than that which produced the
works of learning which fill the last twenty years of his life.</p>

<p>When Petrarch first met Boccaccio, as we have seen, it
was not so much of Italian letters as of antiquity that
they spoke; and ever after we find that the elder poet
brings the conversation back to that, to him the most
important of subjects, when Boccaccio, with his keener
sense of life and greater vitality, would have involved him
in political discussion, or persuaded him to consider such
aspects of the life of his own time as are to be found, for
instance, so plentifully in the <cite>Decameron</cite>. Seeing the
way Petrarch was determined to follow, venerating him as
his master and leader, always ready to give him the first
place, it is not surprising that Boccaccio interested himself
more and more in what so engrossed his friend. In
1354 Petrarch thanks him<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> for an anthology from the
works of Cicero and Varro that he had composed and
given him, and in the same year he thanks him again for
S. Augustine's Commentary on the Psalms.</p>

<p>Long before he met Boccaccio in Florence in 1350,
however, Petrarch had begun the study of Greek in
Avignon in 1342 under the Basilian monk Barlaam,<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
whom he had met there in 1339.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>According to Boccaccio, Barlaam was a man of small
stature but of prodigious learning, the Abbot of the
monastery of S. Gregory, a bitter theological disputant with
many enemies, but in high favour at the court of Constantinople,
whence the Emperor Andronicus had sent him
to Avignon ostensibly on a mission for the reunion of the
Churches, but really to ask for the assistance of the West
in the struggle with the Turks. Barlaam was in fact
a Calabrian, but most of his life had been spent in
Salonica and Constantinople. He knew Greek; that was
his value in Petrarch's eyes, and he seems to have read
with the poet certain dialogues of Plato.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> In 1342, however,
Barlaam become Bishop of Gerace,<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> and Petrarch lost
him before his greatest desire had begun to be satisfied, to
wit, the translation of Homer, which, with the Middle Age,
he only knew in the mediocre abridgment <cite>Ilias Latina</cite>,
the weakness of which he recognised.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Eleven years later,
in 1353, however, Petrarch met in Avignon Nicolas
Sigeros, another ambassador of the Emperor of Constantinople,
come on a similar mission to Barlaam's. They
spoke together of Homer, and in the following year when
Sigeros was departed, he sent Petrarch as a gift the Greek
text of the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite>. This the poet received
with an enthusiastic letter of thanks, at the same time
confessing his insufficiency as a Hellenist.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>Now in the winter of 1358-9, during a sojourn at
Padua, there was introduced to Petrarch by one of his
friends a certain Leon Pilatus, who gave himself out for
a Greek; and the poet seized the opportunity to get a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>translation of a part of his MS. of Homer.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> In the
spring, however, he went to Milan, and it was there,
on March 16, 1359, that Boccaccio visited him, finding
him in his garden "in orto Sanctæ Valeriæ Mediolani."<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>That visit, from one point of view so consoling for
Boccaccio, must have cost him a pang; for he had, as we
have seen, always blamed Petrarch for accepting the
hospitality of the Visconti, those enemies of his country.
But he had not allowed the fact that Petrarch had disregarded
his protests to interfere with their friendship.
Keen patriot as he always remained, Boccaccio, without in
any way changing his opinion, accepted Petrarch's strange
conduct, his indifference to nationalism, with a modesty as
charming as it is rare, and allowing himself to take up
the attitude of a disciple, made a pilgrimage to the city he
hated for the sake of the friend he loved; and cost what it
may have done, that visit, long planned we gather, must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>have been full of refreshment for Boccaccio. We see them
in that quiet garden in Visconti's city planting a laurel, a
favourite amusement of Petrarch's, for it reminded him
alike of Laura and of his coronation as poet;<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> and, "as
the pleasant days slipped by," talking of poetry, of learning,
above all of Greek and of that Leon Pilatus recently
come into Italy, whom Petrarch had met in Padua.</p>

<p>It is probable that Boccaccio met this man in Milan
before he returned to Florence;<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> it is certain that Petrarch
spoke to him of Pilatus, and that Boccaccio asked him to
visit him. That invitation was accepted, and before the
end of the year we see Pilatus established in Florence.</p>

<p>This man who makes such a bizarre figure in Boccaccio's
life seems to have belonged to that numerous race of
adventurers half Greek, half Calabrian, needy, unscrupulous,
casual, and avaricious, who ceaselessly wandered about
Europe in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries seeking
fortune. It might seem strange that such an one should
play the part of a teacher and professor, but he certainly
was not particular, and Petrarch and Boccaccio were
compelled to put up with what they could get. Pilatus,
however, seems to have wearied and disgusted Petrarch;
it was Boccaccio, more gentle and more heroic, who devoted
himself to him for the sake of learning. Having
persuaded Pilatus to follow him to Florence, he caused a
Chair of Greek to be given to him in the university, and
for almost four years imposed upon himself the society
of this disagreeable barbarian. For as it seems he was
nothing else; his one claim on the attention of Petrarch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>and Boccaccio being that he could, or said he could, speak
Greek.</p>

<p>We know very little about him. He boasted that he
was born in Thessaly, but later owned that he was a
Calabrian.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> His appearance, according to Boccaccio
   <a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> and
Petrarch,<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> had something
   <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text was 'repellant'">repellent</ins> about it. His crabbed
countenance was covered with bristles of black hair, an
untrimmed beard completing the effect; and his ragged
mantle only half covered his dirty person. Nor were his
manners more refined than his physique; while his character
seems to have been particularly disagreeable, sombre,
capricious, and surly. Petrarch confesses that he had given
up trying to civilise this rustic, this "magna bellua."<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>Such was Leon Pilatus; but for the love of Greek
Boccaccio pardoned everything, and he and two or three
friends, the only persons in Florence indeed able to do so,
followed the lectures<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> of this improvised professor. But it
was above all in admitting this creature to his own home
that Boccaccio appears most heroic. There he submitted
him to long interviews and interminable <i>séances</i> in order
that he might accomplish the great task of a complete
translation of Homer.</p>

<p>Afar off Petrarch associated himself with this work and
tried to direct it with wise counsels that Leon Pilatus
was doubtless too little of a scholar to understand and
too ignorant to follow blindly. In fact but for Petrarch,
as the following letter proves, they would have lacked the
text itself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You ask me," he writes in 1360,<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> "to lend you, if as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>you think I have bought it, the book of Homer that was
for sale at Padua, in order that our friend Leon may
translate it from Greek into Latin for you and for our
other studious compatriots, for you say I have long since
had another example. I have seen this book, but I have
neglected it, because it appeared to me inferior to my
own. One could easily get it, however, through the person
who procured me the friendship of Leon; a letter of his
would be all-powerful and I will write him myself. If
by chance this book escapes us, which I do not believe,
I will lend you mine. For I have always been desirous
of this translation in particular and of Greek literature in
general, and if Fortune had not been envious of my
beginnings in the miserable death of my excellent master
(? Barlaam), I should perhaps have to-day something more
of Greek than the alphabet.</p>

<p>"I applaud, then, with all my heart and strength your
enterprise.... I am sorry to see so much solicitude for
the bad and so much negligence of the good. But what
would you? One must resign oneself to it....</p>

<p>"I hope also here and now to prevent you in one thing,
so as not to repent myself later for having passed it by in
silence. You say that the translation will be word for
word. Hear how on this point S. Jerome expresses himself
in the preface to the book <cite>De Temporibus</cite> of Eusebius
of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text was 'Cesarea'">Cæsarea</ins> that he translated into Latin. It pleases me
to send you the very words of one so learned in both
tongues and in many others, and especially in the art
of translation. 'Let him who says that in translation one
does not lose the grace of the original try to translate
Homer literally into Latin, and into any tongue which he
has, and he will see how ridiculous is the order of the
words and how the most eloquent of poets is made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>stammer like a child.' I tell you this for your advice
whilst there is yet time, so that such a great work may
not be useless.</p>

<p>"For myself I desire only that the thing be well done....
In truth the portion I have which the same Leon
translated for me into Latin prose&mdash;the beginning of
Homer&mdash;has given me a foretaste of the complete work....
It contains indeed a secret charm.... Go on then
with the aid of Heaven; give us back Homer who was
lost to us....</p>

<p>"In asking me at the same time for the volume of Plato
that I have with me and that escaped the fire in my
house across the Alps, you give me a proof of your ardour,
and I will hold this book at your disposition when you
want it. I will second with all my power such noble
enterprises. But take care that the union of these two
great Princes of Greece be not unseemly, and that the
weight of these two geniuses does not crush the shoulders
of mortals.... And remember that the one wrote many
centuries before the other. Good-bye. Milan, 18 August
(1360)."<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>From that letter we may gather how eagerly Boccaccio
had turned to this new labour. Was it in order to escape
from himself? Certainly it might seem that in his new
enthusiasm he found for a time, at any rate, a certain consolation;
but the crisis was not long delayed. In those
long months while the wretched Pilatus was with him,
however, he was able for a time to ward off the danger;
and realising this, the comedy of that friendship is almost
pathetic.</p>

<p>We seem to see him eagerly drinking in the words that
fell from the surly Calabrian, pressing him with questions,
taking note of all and trying to understand everything&mdash;even
what his master himself could not understand. As
for the master, flattered and puffed up by the confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
that Boccaccio seems to have felt in him, he no doubt
replied to all his questionings in the tone of a man who
knew perfectly what he was talking about, and had
nothing to fear or to hide. Sometimes, no doubt, the
adventurer showed itself. Weary and bored by the incessant
work, his sullen humour exasperated by the
sedentary life, Pilatus would demand his liberty. Then
Boccaccio would have to arm himself with all his patience,
and by sweetness and gentleness and good-humour would
at last persuade the wretched man to remain a little longer
with him.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the midst of this difficult work with Pilatus
his trouble descended upon him, with a supernatural force
as he thought. He received a message from a dying saint&mdash;a
message that warned him of his approaching end and
certain damnation unless he should repent. When exactly
this message reached him we do not know. It may well
have been in the end of 1361, but it was more probably in
the first months of 1362. He was in any case in no fit
state to meet the blow.</p>

<p>In those days when political crises followed hard on
one another, and the very aspect of a city might change
in the course of a few years, Boccaccio's youth must then
have seemed infinitely far away. His <cite>Corbaccio</cite> had been
written "to open the eyes of the young" to the horror of
woman. While in very many ways he is the pioneer
of the Renaissance, in his heart there lingered yet something,
if only a shadow, of the fear of joy. All his joys
had been adventures on which he scarcely dared to enter,
and while he was never a puritan, as one sometimes thinks
Petrarch may have been, he was so perfectly of his own
time as to "repent him of his past life." For a nature
like that of Boccaccio was capable only of enthusiasm. He
had loved Fiammetta to distraction, and those who only see
there a lust of the flesh have never understood Boccaccio.
His other loves were what you will, what they always are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and must be; but when Fiammetta died, the very centre
of his world was shaken.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> He could not follow her through
Hell and Purgatory into the meadows of Paradise as
Dante had followed Beatrice: he was of the modern
world. For Dante, earth, heaven, purgatory, and hell
were but chambers in the universe of God. For Boccaccio
there remained just the world.</p>

<p>Having the religious sense, he accused himself of sin as
St. Paul had done, as St. John of the Cross was to do,
with an astonishing eccentricity, an exaggeration which
lost sight of the truth, in a profound self-humiliation. Of
such is the lust of the spirit. He too had found it difficult
"to keep in the right way amid the temptations of the
world." And then, suddenly it seems, on the threshold of
old age, poor and alone, he thought to love God with the
same enthusiasm with which he had loved woman. He
was not capable of it; his whole life rose up to deny him
this impassioned consolation, and his "spirit was troubled,"
as the wise and steadfast eyes of Petrarch had seen.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of this disease, to escape from which,
as we may think, he had so eagerly thrown himself into
the translation of Homer with Pilatus, that a certain
Gioacchino Ciani sought him out to warn him, as he intended
to warn Petrarch, of the nearness of death. In
doing this the monk, for he was a Carthusian, was but
obeying the dying commands of the Beato Pietro Petroni,<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>a Sienese who had seen on his death-bed "the present, the
past, and the future." Already drawn towards a new life&mdash;a
life which under the direction of the Church he was
told would be without the consolations of literature&mdash;at
the sudden intervention, as it seemed, of Heaven, Boccaccio
did the wisest thing of his whole life&mdash;he asked for
the advice of Petrarch.</p>

<p>The letter which Petrarch wrote him takes its rank
among the noblest of his writings, and is indeed one of the
most beautiful letters ever written.</p>

<p>"Your letter," he says&mdash;"Your letter, my brother, has
filled me with an extraordinary trouble. In reading it I
became the prey of a great astonishment, and also of a
great chagrin: after reading it both the one and the other
have disappeared. How could I read without weeping the
story of your tears and of your approaching death, being
totally ignorant of the facts and only paying attention to
the words? But at last when I had turned and fixed my
thoughts on the thing itself, the state of my soul changed
altogether, and both astonishment and chagrin fled
away....</p>

<p>"You tell me that this holy man had a vision of our
Lord, and so was able to discern all truth&mdash;a great sight
for mortal eyes to see. Great indeed, I agree with you, if
genuine; but how often have we not known this tale of a
vision made a cloak for an imposture? And having visited
you, this messenger proposed, I understand, to go to Naples,
thence to Gaul and Britain, and so to me. Well, when he
comes I will examine him closely; his looks, his demeanour,
his behaviour under questioning, and so forth, shall
help me to judge of his truthfulness. And the holy man
on his death-bed saw us two and a few others to whom
he had a secret message, which he charged this visitor of
yours to give us; so, if I understand you rightly, runs the
story. Well, the message to you is twofold: you have not
long to live, and you must give up poetry. Hence your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
trouble, which I made my own while reading your letter,
but which I put away from me on thinking it over, as you
will do also; for if you will only give heed to me, or rather
to your own natural good sense, you will see that you have
been distressing yourself about a thing that should have
pleased you. Now if this message is really from the Lord,
it must be pure truth. But is it from the Lord? Or has
its real author used the Lord's name to give weight to his
own saying? I grant you the frequency of death-bed
prophecies; the histories of Greece and Rome are full of
instances; but even though we allow that these old stories
and your monitor's present tale are all true, still what is
there to distress you so terribly? What is there new in
all this? You knew without his telling you that you
could not have a very long space of life before you. And
is not our life here labour and sorrow, and is it not its chief
merit that it is the road to a better?... Ah! but you have
come to old age, says your monitor. Death cannot be far
off. Look to your soul. Well, I grant you that scholarship
may be an unreasonable and even bitter pursuit for
the old, if they take it up then for the first time; but if
you and your scholarship have grown old together, 'tis the
pleasantest of comforts. Forsake the Muses, says he:
many things that may grace a lad are a disgrace to an
old man; wit and the senses fail you. Nay, I answer,
when he bids you pluck sin from your heart, he speaks
well and prudently. But why forsake learning, in which
you are no novice but an expert, able to discern what to
choose and what to refuse?... All history is full of
examples of good men who have loved learning, and
though many unlettered men have attained to holiness,
no man was ever debarred from holiness by letters....
But if in spite of all this you persist in your intention, and
if you must needs throw away not only your learning, but
the poor instruments of it, then I thank you for giving me
the refusal of your books. I will buy your library, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
must be sold, for I would not that the books of so great a
man should be dispersed abroad and hawked about by
unworthy hands. I will buy it and unite it with my own;
then some day this mood of yours will pass, some day you
will come back to your old devotion. Then you shall
make your home with me, you will find your books side
by side with mine, which are equally yours. Thenceforth
we shall share a common life and a common library, and
when the survivor of us is dead, the books shall go to
some place where they will be kept together and dutifully
tended, in perpetual memory of us who owned them."<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>That noble letter, so sane in its piety, in some sort cured
Boccaccio. We hear no more of the fanatic monk, and
the books were never bought, for they were never sold.
Petrarch, however, did not forget his friend. He caused
the office of Apostolic Secretary to be offered him,
and that Boccaccio had the strength and independence to
refuse the sinecure assures us of his restored sanity.</p>

<p>But we may well ask ourselves what had brought
Boccaccio to such a pass that he was at the mercy of such
infernal humbugs and liars as the Blessed Pietro and his
rascal friend. That he was in a wretched state of mind and
soul we know, and the causes we know too in part, but they
by no means account for the fact that the first enemy of
monks and friars and all their blackguardism should have
fallen so easily into their hands. Was Boccaccio superstitious?
That he was less superstitious, less credulous,
than the men of his time generally is certain; that he was
content to believe what Petrarch attacked and laughed at
we shall presently see; but that he can be properly accused
of superstition remains doubtful. Certainly he believed in
dreams;<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> he believed in astrology;<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> he believed that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>strabism or squint was an indication of an evil soul;<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> he
believed in visible devils;<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> he believed that Æneas truly
descended into Hades and that Virgil was a magician.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
He may well have believed all such things and have been
no worse off than many a Prince of the Church to-day; at
any rate, such beliefs, unreasonable as they may appear to
us, cannot have led him to the incredible folly of believing
in the Blessed Pietro and his messenger.</p>

<p>It might seem inexplicable that he who had exposed the
lies and tricks of the monks so often should have been
himself so easily deceived. Had he not exposed them?
There was Fra Cipolla&mdash;true he was a friar&mdash;part of
whose stock-in-trade was a tale of relics&mdash;"the finger of
the Holy Ghost as whole and entire as ever it was, the
tuft of the seraph that appeared to S. Francis and one of
the nails of the cherubim, one of the ribs of the Verbum
caro fatti alle finestre (factum est) and some of the vestment
of the Holy Catholic Faith, some of the rays of the
star that appeared to the Magi, a phial of the sweat of
S. Michael abattling with the Devil, the jaws of death of
S. Lazarus, and other relics."<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>It might seem inexplicable! Unfortunately, however,
Boccaccio also believed that those about to die can participate
in the spirit of prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Thus he was for the
moment, at any rate, altogether at the mercy of the Blessed
Pietro. The splendid common-sense, the caustic wit of
Petrarch helped him, it is true, to recover himself, but that
bitter and humiliating experience left a permanent mark
upon him. He was a changed man. With an immense
regret he looked back on his life, and would have destroyed
if he could the gay works of his youth, even the <cite>Decameron</cite>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>and, for a time at least, he would have been content to sacrifice
everything, not only his poetry in the vulgar and his
romances and stories, but the new learning itself, the study
of antiquity, and to enter into some monastery.</p>

<p>That he did not do so we owe in part at least to
Petrarch. For when he had read his letter and come
to himself, he returned to Pilatus and the translation of
Homer.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>That translation was scarcely finished when Pilatus
wished to be gone, and he seems in fact to have accompanied
Boccaccio to Venice on his visit to Petrarch
probably in May, 1363.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> That visit was a kind of flight;
he seems to have taken refuge with Petrarch from the fears
of his own heart, and that it was as full of pleasure and
enjoyment for Petrarch, as of consolation for Boccaccio,
happily we know and can assert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>"I have always thought," Petrarch writes to him after
his return to Tuscany,<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> "I have always thought that
your presence would give me pleasure, I knew it would,
and I felt that it would please you too. What I did not
know, however, was that it would bring good fortune. For
during the very few months, gone so quickly, that you
have cared to dwell with me in this house that I call mine,
and which is yours, it seems to me, in truth, that I have
contracted a truce with fortune who, while you were here,
dared not spoil my happiness...."</p>

<p>We know nothing more of that visit save that Boccaccio
must have returned to Tuscany before the writing of that
letter, before the 7th of September then. As for Pilatus, he
too left Venice "at the end of the summer"<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> to return to
Constantinople, "cursing Italy and the Latin name," as
Petrarch says. "One would have thought him scarcely
arrived there," Petrarch continues, "when I received
a badly written and very long letter, more untidy than
his beard or his hair, in which among other things he
said he loved and longed for Italy as for some heavenly
country, that he hated Greece which he had loved and
execrated Byzantium which he had praised, and he supplicated
me to send for him back as eagerly as Peter, about
to be shipwrecked, prayed Christ to still the waves."</p>

<p>To make a long story short, Petrarch ignored his
petition. This, however, did not stop Pilatus. He embarked
for Italy, but a storm wrecked the ship in which
he sailed in the Adriatic, and though he was not drowned
he was struck and killed by lightning. Petrarch wonders if
amid his "wretched baggage, which, thanks to the honesty
of the sailors, is in safety, I shall find the Euripides,
Sophocles, and other manuscripts which he had promised
to procure for me."<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The two friends mourned him
sincerely, forgetting their disgust in remembering that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>Pilatus had known Greek, and finding touching words to
deplore the tragic death of the first translator of Homer.</p>

<i>(By the courtesy of Messrs. J. &amp; J. Leighton.)</i></div>
</div>

<p>As for the translation he had made, Petrarch did not see
it for some years. The first time he asks for it is in a
letter of March 1, 1364.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> There he asks for a fragment
of the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">partem illam Odysseæ qua Ulyxes it ad
inferos et locorum quæ in vestibulo Erebi sunt descriptionem
ab Homero factam ... quam primum potes ...
utcumque tuis digitis exaratam</span>." Later he asks for the
whole: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In futurum autem, si me amas, vide obsecro an
tuo studio, mea impensa fieri possit ut Homerus integer
bibliothecam hanc ubi pridem graecus habitat, tandem
latinos accedat</span>." These words are very clear. Petrarch
says he will pay the copyist himself. So that, as Hortis
asserts, the first version of Homer was made at the suggestion
of Petrarch by Pilatus at the expense of Boccaccio.</p>

<p>In the letter of December 14, 1365,<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Petrarch thanks
Boccaccio for sending him the <cite>Iliad</cite> and a part of the
<cite>Odyssey</cite>; but that part did not contain the details he
wanted concerning the descent of Ulysses into Hades and
his voyage along the Italian shores. Even this incomplete
copy, though sent off in 1365 by Boccaccio, was a long
time in reaching him. On January 27, 1366, he had not
yet received it.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> But at last it arrived, and Petrarch wrote
to thank Boccaccio for it.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> This letter, however, is not
dated, and its contents do not help us to decide exactly
when it was written. At any rate, it was after January,
1366, that Petrarch received the precious work. He
promised to return this MS. to Boccaccio when he had had
it copied; but he seems to have found it difficult to get
a capable person to do this; and when he had found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>him we see him travelling about with him, that the work
might be done under his constant supervision.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>It is this MS., which M. de Nohlac discusses and
describes, that is now in Paris (Bib. Nat., 7880, 1). In it we
are able to judge of the extent of Pilatus's knowledge.
That he knew Greek seems incontrovertible, but that he
knew the Homeric idiom very imperfectly is not less certain;
he seems too to have had a poor knowledge of
Latin. His translation is full of obscurity, platitude, and
mistranslations&mdash;in fact, crammed with all the errors of a
schoolboy: when he does not know a word, and has to
confess it, he writes the Greek word in Latin characters;
what we see in fact is not a faithful but a blind translation.
And it was for this that Petrarch had waited so
patiently! "Penelope," he says, "had not more ardently
longed for Ulysses."<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> He studied it with passion, often
deceived, no doubt, but never discouraged. The notes
with which he covered page after page show us the growing
feebleness of his hand, but never of his spirit. He died
while he was annotating the <cite>Odyssey</cite>.</p>

<p>Boccaccio, on the other hand, with a charming and naive
sincerity, owns that he did not understand much, but adds
that the little he did understand seemed to him beautiful.
He was very proud of his victory, and rightly; for by its
means the Renaissance was able to give Homer his rightful
place in its culture.</p>

<p class="pfs90">1363-1372</p>
<p class="pfs90 w-sp">THE EMBASSIES TO THE POPE&mdash;VISITS TO VENICE AND
NAPLES&mdash;BOCCACCIO'S LOVE OF CHILDREN</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">Boccaccio</span> returned from Venice to Tuscany
some time before September, 1363, not long
before, as we may think, for the letter Petrarch
wrote him on September 7<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> seems to have followed
close on his heels. It appears that as he was on
the eve of leaving Petrarch, for the last time as it proved,
he had learned that the plague which was raging in
Central and Southern Italy had carried off Lello di Pietro
Stefano and Francesco Nelli, their common friends, Lelius
and Simonides, as Petrarch calls them. Disliking to be the
bearer of ill-tidings, Boccaccio had departed from Venice,
leaving Petrarch to learn of this disaster from others, and
a good part of the letter Petrarch wrote him, immediately
after he was gone, it seems, is devoted to deploring the
death of their friends.</p>

<p>"An hour after your departure," he writes, "the priest
whom I had charged to carry a letter to my friend Lelius
returned bringing me my letter unopened. It was not
necessary for him to speak; his face told me the news....
But while with my hand I soothed this new wound, and
tried to catch my breath, a second blow fell upon me. He
in whose arms he expired told me of the death of our
Simonides.... You are almost the only companion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
learning left to me.... This year 1363, which is the
sixteenth from the beginning of our miseries [from the
plague of 1348], has renewed the attack on many noble
cities, among others on Florence.... To this disaster is
added the fury of a war against the Pisans ... of which
the issue is still uncertain."</p>

<p>Petrarch might well be uneasy. Though never a good
patriot as Boccaccio always was, he could not but be
moved at the misfortunes of Florence, which had only
escaped the attentions of Pandolfo Malatesta by placing
herself almost at the mercy of Hawkwood and his White
Company of Englishmen, fighting in the Pisan service.
That winter, to the astonishment of all, a campaign was
fought, for the English laughed at the Italian winter,
colder maybe, but so much drier than their own, and by
the spring Visconti had made peace with the Pope and
with the Marquis of Montferrat, so that they were able to
send Baumgarten's German company, 3000 strong, to the
assistance of the Pisans, who had now not less than 6000
mercenaries in their service. Those were very anxious
times in Florence, the whole <i>contado</i> being at the mercy
of Hawkwood, and when, by the intervention of the Pope,
peace was signed in the autumn of 1364, she must have
been thankful, more especially as Pisa engaged to pay her
100,000 florins indemnity within ten years.</p>

<p>The Pope, however, was far from satisfied with Florence.
He found her to have been lukewarm in the service of
the Church when Romagna and the Marche rebelled,
which, if true, was not surprising, for he had played
fast and loose with her liberty, and now accused her
of neglecting his interests and of attempting to detach
other cities from his cause. These among other accusations;
in return he threatened no longer to grant her his
goodwill.</p>

<p>The whole situation was serious. The temporal
power of the Church with the victories of Albornoz was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
again growing in Italy; it was now certain that the Pope
would one day return. It was necessary to placate him.
And again in this delicate mission the Florentines employed
Boccaccio.</p>

<p>It cannot have been with very great enthusiasm that
Boccaccio learned he was once more to cross the Alps
on a mission as difficult as any he had handled. He had
returned from Venice in 1363 quieted, altogether reconciled,
for a time at any rate, with himself, determined not
to abandon his work. Ever since 1359, certainly, he had
devoted himself to learning, to the study of Greek and the
Latin classics, of the great early Christian writers, and to
the accumulation of knowledge. For ten years now, ever
since the failure of his mission in 1354, he had not been
asked to undertake diplomatic business, and whether or
no that neglect had been due to his failure or to his intercourse
with Pino de' Rossi, who in 1360 was implicated in a
conspiracy against the Guelfs, it cannot have been anything
but distressing, we may think, to one so patriotic, so
interested in politics too, as Boccaccio, to have been so
long neglected, only to be made use of again in his old
age. But the true patriot is always ready to serve his
country, be she never so neglectful, and so, in spite of
the interference with his plans, and the hardness and
trials of the journey, it was not altogether, we may be
sure, without a sort of pride and gladness that he set out
for Avignon in August, 1365.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
His business was to convince the Pope that the Florentines
were "the most faithful and most devout servants of
Holy Church." Besides the letters which he bore for Francesco
Bruni and others in Avignon, Boccaccio also carried
one from the Republic to the Doge of Genoa,<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> and he remained
in that city for a season. It is to his stay there
that, as he tells us in the <i>argomento</i>, his thirteenth Eclogue
refers. In that poem he tells us that he and the poet called
Dafni had a discussion with a merchant Stilbone, of which
Criti was judge. Stilbone eagerly praises riches at the
expense of poetry, reminding Dafni how many are the
perils that menace that fragile glory which poets value so
highly, such as fire and war, which may easily destroy
their works. Dafni, on the other hand, celebrates the
power of poetry, which recalls the minds of men from
the depths of Erebus. Criti praises both riches and
poetry, but does not decide between them.</p>

<p>While Boccaccio was in Genoa, it seems, Petrarch
thought he should have visited him in Pavia on his way to
Avignon, but owing to the need for haste, the fatigue of
the way, and the difficulties he feared to encounter at his age
on the route, he was compelled not to do so. Later, on
December 14, Petrarch wrote him of his disappointment:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>"You have done well to visit me at least by letter, since
you did not care, or you were unable, to visit me in person.
Having heard that you were crossing the Alps to see the
Babylon of the West, far worse than that of the East,
because she is nearer to us, I was uneasy about the result
of your voyage until I heard that you had returned.
Knowing now for many years, by my frequent journeys,
the difficulties of the roads, and remembering the weightiness
of your body and the gravity of your spirit, friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>of a studious leisure, and by consequence enemies of such
cares and of such business, not a day, not a night has
passed tranquilly for me. I thank God that you have
remained safe and sound.... Assuredly, if you had not
been very pressed, it would not have been difficult, since
you were in Genoa, to come on here. It is only two days'
journey. You would have seen me ... and you would
have seen what you have not seen it seems to me&mdash;the
town of Pavia (Ticinum) on the banks of the Ticino....
But since circumstances have willed that I should be
deprived of your greeting, as you say, because of the
fatigue of the journey and your mistrust of your strength,
and because of the shortness of the time at your disposal
and the order of the fatherland which awaits your return,
I could have desired at least that you should have met my
friend Guido [Guido Settimo], Archbishop of Genoa. In
seeing him you would have seen me, for since infancy
I have lived with him in perfect conformity of will and
sentiment. And, believe me, you would have seen a man
who, though weak in body, has a spirit of great energy;
you would have said you had never seen any one more full
of vitality...."</p>

<p>Petrarch was evidently hurt that Boccaccio had not
been able to go to Pavia. It was necessary, however, for
him to reach Avignon with all speed. And there, indeed,
he was welcomed by Petrarch's friends. For that letter,
so full of regrets, continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But to end my complaints with a congratulation,
I am glad that in Babylon itself you have seen those
friends that death has left me, and, above all, him who, as
you say, is a veritable father: my dear Filippo, Patriarch
of Jerusalem. To paint him in a few words, he is a man
as great as his title, and indeed he is worthy of the
Papacy if one day that should add itself to his merits.
You write me that without having known you till then, he
held you in a long embrace and pressed you closely and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
affectionately, even as I myself would have done, in the
utmost friendship, in the presence of the sovereign pontiff
and his astonished cardinals...."</p>

<p>Boccaccio seems to have remained in Avignon till
November. His mission did not meet with much success:
the Pope was hard to persuade and to convince. For all
this trouble and fatigue Boccaccio received from the
Republic ninety florins of gold, at the rate of four florins a
day. This certainly could by no means have met all his
expenses. Poor as he was, he had to pay for the honour
of serving his country.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>That was probably the most important, though, as we
shall see, not the last of Boccaccio's missions. It was the
eve of the Pope's return to Rome, and once more Italy
seemed to be in sight of a kind of peace.</p>

<p>The year 1366 was probably spent by Boccaccio at
Certaldo in meditation and work; but in 1367, troubled
again in spirit, as it seems, and very poor, he suddenly
decided to set out for Venice to see Petrarch.</p>

<p>He left Certaldo on March 24,<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> but coming to Florence,
"the continual rains, the dissuasions of friends, and the fear
of the dangers of the way," added to the tales of those
who had made the journey from Bologna, caused him to
hesitate. Then he learned that Petrarch had left Venice
for Pavia, and was once more a guest of the Visconti, so
that he was on the point of giving up his journey.
But the desire to see again some of those friends he had
met before in Venice, and, above all, the thought of seeing
Petrarch's daughter and her husband, "Thy Tullia and
her Francesco," whom he had not met before, decided
him to continue a journey he accomplished not without
much weariness.</p>

<p>On the way, as it happened, he met Petrarch's son-in-law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Franceschino da Brossano di Amicolo, whose character,
voice, and beauty he praises so highly. "After festive
and friendly greetings, after learning from him that you
were safe and sound, and much other good news
concerning you, I began to consider him, his form and
beauty (cœpi aliquandiu mecum meditari pregrandem
hominis formam), his quiet and pleasing face, his calm
words ... how I praised your choice. Finally he left
me, for he had business to do. And I in the earliest
dawn went aboard my little boat (naviculam) and immediately
set out for the Venetian shore, where I landed
and would have sent at once to announce myself, but
some of our brother citizens were already about me and
offering me hospitality.... In spite, however, of Donato's
pressing invitation, I went off with Francesco Allegri....
I tell you all this in all these words to excuse myself for
not having accepted the offer you made me so warmly by
letter; but if my friends had not been there to meet me
I should have gone to an inn rather than have dwelt in
the house of Tullia while her husband was absent. However,
although you know in this and in many other things
the integrity of my heart towards you, all others would not
know it, and some would have jeered in spite of my white
hair (canum caput) and my age and my fatness and
feebleness, which should surely shut their mouths. This
kind of thing is easily and willingly believed by evil-minded
scandal-mongers, who prefer a lie to the truth.</p>

<p>"After reposing myself a little I went to salute Tullia,
who had already heard of my arrival.... She met me
joyfully, blushing a little, and looking on the ground, with
modesty and filial affection, and she saluted and embraced
me....</p>

<p>"Presently we were talking in your charming little garden
with some friends, and she offered me with matronly
serenity your house, your books, and all your things
there. Suddenly little footsteps&mdash;and there came towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
us thy Eletta, my delight, who, without knowing who I
was, looked at me smiling. I was not only delighted, I
greedily took her in my arms, imagining that I held my
little one (virgunculam olim meam) that is lost to me.
What shall I say? If you do not believe me, you will
believe Guglielmo da Ravenna, the physician, and our
Donato, who knew her. Your little one has the same
aspect that she had who was my Eletta, the same expression,
the same light in the eyes, the same laughter there,
the same gestures, the same way of walking, the same
way of carrying all her little person; only my Eletta
was, it is true, a little taller when at the age of five
and a half I saw her for the last time.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> Besides, she talks
in the same way, uses the same words, and has the same
simplicity. Indeed, indeed, there is no difference save that
thy little one is golden-haired, while mine had chestnut
tresses (aurea cesaries tuæ est, meæ inter nigram rufamque
fuit). Ah me! how many times when I have held thine
in my arms listening to her prattle the memory of my
baby stolen away from me has brought tears to my eyes&mdash;which
I let no one see."</p>

</div>

<p>That love of children so characteristic in an Italian,
and yet so surprising in Boccaccio to those who without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>understanding the real simplicity of his nature have been
content to think of him as a mere teller of doubtful
stories, is one of the most natural and beautiful traits in
his character. The little Eletta, "my delight," appears
like a ray of sunshine in a lonely and even gloomy old
age, which we may think perhaps, had Violante lived,
might have been less bitter, less hard to bear than it
proved to be. Nor is this by any means the only glimpse
he gives us of his interest in children. Apart from the
neglected portraits of the <cite>Decameron</cite>, we find him referring
to them, their health and upbringing, in the <cite>Commentary
on the Divine Comedy</cite>, when he speaks of the
danger they are in from careless or neglectful nurses, who
put them to rest or sleep in the light and thus hurt their
eyes and induce them to squint; and yet he can believe,
though probably with less than the common conviction,
that a squint is the sign of an evil nature dangerous
alike to the afflicted person and to those whom he may
encounter.</p>

<p>The letter to Petrarch, however, does not end with
Eletta. Boccaccio proceeds to speak of Tullia and her
husband Francesco, who presently returned to Venice,
and finding him there would have made him his guest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and when he refused insisted on his daily presence at his
table. Nor was this all, for Boccaccio tells us that on the
eve of his departure, Francesco, knowing him to be very
short of money, managed to get him into a quiet corner,
and putting his strong hand on the feeble arm of his
guest, would not let him depart till he had given him
succour, rushing away before he could thank him. "Knowing
me to be poor," Boccaccio writes, "on my departure
from Venice, the hour being already late, he led me into a
corner (in secessu domus me traxit) and in a few words,
his great hands on my feeble arm (manibus illis giganteis
suis in brachiolum meum injectis), forced me in spite of my
embarrassment to accept his great liberality and then
escaped, saying good-bye as he went, leaving me to blame
myself. May God render it him again!"</p>

<p>It is perhaps in that letter we see Boccaccio better than
in any other of his writings; the greatest man then in
Italy playing with a little child, obliged in his poverty to
accept assistance from one who was almost a stranger. It
was on the 30th June that Boccaccio wrote that letter to
Petrarch from Florence, so that he would seem to have
arrived home about midsummer.</p>

<p>In the following year we catch sight of him again in the
service of the Republic, first, as one of the Camarlinghi,<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
later, on an embassy to the Pope, who had set out for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Italy in April, and had entered Rome in October,
1367.<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>In 1365 Urban had been besieged in Avignon by
Duguesclin on his way to Spain, and had had to pay an
enormous ransom as well as to absolve his enemy and his
followers from all censures. This mishap, coupled with
the invitation of the Romans, the passionate exhortations
of Peter of Aragon, the eloquent appeal of Petrarch, and
the urgent call of Albornoz, seems to have induced the
Pope to undertake this adventure, which he had always
looked forward to. He sailed, in spite of the opposition
of the King of France, for Corneto, and at last came
safely to Viterbo, which he entered in state on June 9,
1367, "with such grace and exultation that it seemed the
very stones would cry, 'Blessed is he who cometh in the
name of the Lord.'"<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> In Viterbo the Pope began to
arrange a league against the Visconti, but he was already
having trouble with Siena, and on August 20 the great
Albornoz died. In September, too, a French tumult
broke out in the city, and though Florence, Siena, and
even Rome sent aid, Urban was besieged for three days,
and was doubtless very glad to set out under the escort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>of the Marquis of Ferrara on October 14 for Rome. Two
days later he entered the City in triumph riding on a
white mule; he was received with "universal joy and
acclamation."</p>

<p>In the spring of 1368 the Emperor, in accordance with
his long unfulfilled promise to the league, came into Italy
with an army to bridle the Visconti. The Papal forces and
those of Giovanna of Naples joined his, but achieved
nothing. Then the Emperor came into Tuscany. The
rising of the Salimbeni followed in Siena, and the Emperor
passed through Siena on his way to Viterbo. On October 21
he entered Rome leading the Pope's mule on foot.</p>

<p>It seems to have been at this moment that the Florentines
thought well to send an embassy to Urban and to
choose Boccaccio once more as their ambassador. All
we know about the affair is, however, that on December 1,
1368, Urban wrote to the Signoria of Florence that he
understood from their ambassador Giovanni Boccaccio
that they desired to assist him in reforming the affairs of
Italy, and that Boccaccio, whom he praises, bears his reply
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">viva voce</i>.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that all Italy was uneasy.
The advent of the Emperor had ruined the peace of
Tuscany, Lombardy was ablaze with war, the Papacy was
divided against itself. The French party&mdash;five French
cardinals had altogether refused to leave Avignon&mdash;now
ceased urging the Pope to return. Helpless and disillusioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Urban was at the mercy of the circumstances
in which he found himself, and a year later he in fact
abandoned Italy again, setting out for Avignon in September,
and dying there in December, 1369.</p>

<p>It has been said that in 1368 Boccaccio went to Padua
to see Petrarch.<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> But this seems extremely unlikely, for
quite apart from the fact that his growing infirmities made
such a journey difficult, as we have seen in the previous
year the circumstances of the time made such a journey
almost impossible. Even Petrarch, a born traveller, a
man who delighted in journeying, found it extremely
difficult to make his way from Milan in July of that year,
where he had been present at the marriage of Lionel,
Duke of Clarence, to Violante, Duke Galeazzo Visconti's
daughter, to Padua. "He chartered a boat," we read,
"coaxed a half-frightened company of boatmen to work
her, with no weapons to defend himself, and sailed down
the Po. The adventure had an astonishing success.
Through the river-fleets and between the manned squadrons
of both armies sailed this invalid old man of a perfect
courage, and the officers of both hosts vied with one
another in doing him honour. His voyage was a triumphal
progress...." But Boccaccio was not the world-famed
Petrarch.</p>

<p>What does seem certain is that in 1370 he went to
Naples, where he remained till 1371. This journey southward
seems to have been undertaken at the invitation of
a certain Abbate Niccolò di Montefalcone, who, probably
during a sojourn in Tuscany, having borrowed his Tacitus
of Boccaccio, invited the poet to visit him in his convent,
the Certosa di S. Stefano, in Calabria.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>He set out from Certaldo much charmed by the affection
which the Abbate had professed for him, and delighted
at the prospect of visiting his convent, with its shady
woods and tranquil country-side watered by limpid
streams; a place rich in books and in peace. But he
had not reached his destination before he learned that the
Abbate had left Calabria, as he suspected on purpose to
avoid him. He was compelled to turn aside in the winter
rains and to take refuge in Naples. There, justly angry
at the treatment he, a poor and old man, famous too, and
the friend of Petrarch, had received at the hands of a
rascal, he wrote the wretched monk a letter which, that posterity
may add its indignation to his, has happily come
down to us. In that letter, so full of just resentment,
Boccaccio accuses this blackguard of being a liar and a
hypocrite. It is in fact impossible to excuse this unworthy
but too common son of the Church from the
accusations of Boccaccio. He must have known that the
poet was old and infirm and very poor, yet apparently to
amuse himself he put him to the great expense of energy
and money which such a journey entailed.<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> In Florence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
it was said Boccaccio had gone to make him a
monk.</p>

<p>That letter to the Abbate bears the date of xiii. Kal.
Feb. and was written in Naples. The year is indicated
by the fact that Boccaccio speaks there of the
death of Urban V and the election of his successor,
Gregory XI.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> It seems certain then that in January, 1371,
Boccaccio was in Naples.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> There he was befriended by
Conte Ugo di S. Severino, who as soon as he heard of his
arrival and his poverty came to salute him and to offer to
maintain him during his stay, and on his departure presented
him with gifts "more worthy of the giver than the
receiver."</p>

<p>While he was in Naples he also met a friar minor, by
name Ubertino di Corigliano, who had been sent by
Frederic of Sicily to conclude peace with Queen Giovanna.
He was a professor of theology, a learned man and good
talker. Boccaccio spoke with him of the revival of learning.
"God," he says, "has been moved to compassion for
the Italian name.... For in our days great men have
descended from heaven, unless I am mistaken, gifted with
great souls, who have brought back poetry from exile to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>her ancient throne."<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> Who were these men but Dante,
"worthy to be named before all," and his master Petrarch.
He does not add himself, as he well might.<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>He seems to have left Naples in the autumn of 1371
and to have returned to Certaldo, where we find him in
1372, for he writes thence to Piero di Monteforte a letter
dated "Nonis Aprilis."<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> From that quiet retreat, save to
go to Florence, where indeed he had yet to hold the most
honourable post of his whole life, he did not stir again,
during the few years that remained to him.</p>

<h2><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>
<p class="pfs90 w-sp">PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO&mdash;THE LATIN WORKS</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">Those</span> ten years from 1363 to 1372 had not
only been given by Boccaccio to the study of
Greek and the service of his country, they had
also been devoted to a vast and general accumulation
of learning such as was possessed by only one
other man of his time, his master and friend Petrarch. It
might seem that ever since Boccaccio had met Petrarch
he had come under his influence, and in intellectual
matters, at any rate, had been very largely swayed by
him. In accordance with the unfortunate doctrine of his
master, we see him, after 1355, giving up all work in the
vulgar, and setting all his energy on work in the Latin
tongue, in the study of antiquity and the acquirement of
knowledge. From a creative writer of splendid genius he
gradually became a scholar of vast reading but of mediocre
achievement. He seems to have read without ceasing the
works of antiquity, annotating as he read. His learning,
such as it was, became prodigious, immense, and, in a
sense, universal, and little by little he seems to have
gathered his notes into the volumes we know as <cite>De Montibus</cite>,
<cite>Sylvis</cite>, <cite>Fontibus</cite>, <cite>Lacubus</cite>, <cite>Fluminibus</cite>, <cite>Stagnis seu
Paludibus</cite>, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Nominibus Maris Liber</cite>, a sort of dictionary
of Geography;<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Casibus Virorum Illustrium</cite>, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
nine books, which deals with the vanity of human affairs
from Adam to Petrarch;<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Claris Mulieribus</cite>, which
he dedicated to Acciaiuoli's sister, and which begins with
Eve and comes down to Giovanna, Queen of Naples;<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
and the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Genealogiis Deorum</cite>, in fifteen books, dedicated
to Ugo, King of Cyprus and Jerusalem, who had
begged him to write this work, which is a marvellous
cyclopædia of learning concerning mythology<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> and a
defence of poetry and poets.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> In all these works it must
be admitted that we see Boccaccio as Petrarch's disciple,
a pupil who lagged very far behind his master.</p>

<p>As a creative artist, as the author, to name only the
best, of the <cite>Fiammetta</cite> and the <cite>Decameron</cite>, Boccaccio is
the master of a world Petrarch could not enter; he takes
his place with Dante and Chaucer and Shakespeare, and
indeed save Dante no other writer in the Italian tongue
can be compared with him.</p>

<p>It is seldom, however, that a great creative artist is also
a great scholar, for the very energy and virility and restless
impatience which have in some sort enabled him
to create living men and women prevent him in his work
as a student, as an historian pure and simple, in short, as
a scholar. So it was with Boccaccio. The author of the
Latin works is not only inferior to the author of the <cite>Fiammetta</cite>
and the <cite>Decameron</cite>, he is the follower and somewhat
disappointing pupil of Petrarch, who contrives to show us
at every step his inferiority to his master, his feebler sense
of proportion, of philosophy, of the reality of history, above
all his feebler judgment. The consideration of these works
then would seem to demand of us the consideration of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>relations with Petrarch, and it will be convenient at this
point to undertake it as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>Even in his youth Boccaccio had regarded Petrarch
with an enthusiasm and an unenvying modesty that, lasting
as it did his whole life long, ripening as it did into
one of the greatest friendships in the history of Letters,
was perhaps the most beautiful trait in his character. It
always seemed to him an unmerited grace that one who
was sought out by princes and popes, whose fame filled
the universe, should care to be his friend, and this wonder,
this admiration, remained with him till death; he never
writes Petrarch's name without, in his enthusiasm, adding
to it some flattering epithet. He calls him his "illustrious
and sublime master," his "father and lord," "a poet who
is rather of the company of the ancients than of this
modern world," "a man descended from heaven to restore
to Poetry her throne," the "marvel and glory"
of his time.<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> He had known and loved his work, as he
says, for forty years or more,<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> but he had never dared to
approach him, though opportunities had not been altogether
lacking,<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> till Petrarch came to Florence in the
autumn of 1350 on his way to win the indulgence of the
Jubilee in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> This was the beginning of that friendship<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
which is almost without precedent or imitation in
the history of literature. In the following spring, as we
have seen, Boccaccio, in the name of Florence, went to
Padua to recall Petrarch from exile, to offer him a chair in
the new university of his native city, and to restore him
the goods confiscated from his father. In Padua he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>been Petrarch's guest for some days; he was a witness of
Petrarch's enthusiasm for "sacred studies," but apparently
was not personally much interested in them, though he
calls them sacred, for he employed himself with no less
enthusiasm in copying some of Petrarch's works; by
which I at least understand some of his poems in the
vulgar. The evenings were spent in the garden, talking,
on Boccaccio's part of politics, on Petrarch's, as we may
suppose, of learning, often till dawn.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>Boccaccio did not see Petrarch again for eight years,
till in 1359 he visited him in Milan, and in that year sent
him the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, which he had had copied for him;
four years later, after his "conversion," his hysterical adventure
with the messenger of the Blessed Pietro, he went
to meet his master in Venice for the last time,<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> as it
proved, for in 1367 he missed him, Petrarch being then in
Pavia.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> In all these meetings it is Boccaccio who seeks
out Petrarch; his visits are never returned. It is indeed
almost touching to see with what ardour and with what
abnegation Boccaccio cultivates this friendship which was
in fact his greatest pride. He makes Petrarch presents,
poor as he is; he sends him the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, S. Augustine's
<cite>Commentary on the Psalms</cite>, and with his own hand
copies for him a book of extracts from Cicero and Varro.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
We do not hear of Petrarch giving him anything in return.
It is true he lent him the MS. of Homer and another of
Plato, but he borrowed the translation of the former made
at Boccaccio's expense in order to have it copied for
his library. It is ill, however, reckoning up benefits.
Petrarch was not small-minded, as the noble letter in
which he offers to buy his friend's library proves. He
procured for him the offer of the office of Apostolic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>Secretary, which Boccaccio had the strength and independence
to refuse, and in his will left him, since he knew him
to be poor, a cloak to keep him warm on winter nights in
his study. If we find his praise of Boccaccio's work,
especially of the <cite>Decameron</cite>, a little cold and lacking in
spontaneity&mdash;in fact he admits he has not read the
<cite>Decameron</cite>, but only "run through it"<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>&mdash;we must remember
his absurd and pedantic contempt for work in
the vulgar which came upon him in his middle life, so
that he was at last really incapable of judging and was in
fact hostile to Italian literature,<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> and would have destroyed
if he could all his own work in that kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>Boccaccio, on the other hand, was always eager on
Petrarch's behalf and in his defence. He composed an
<cite>Elogium</cite><a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> on him and his poetry, in which he defended him
from certain reproaches which had been brought against
him, and when, as it is said in 1372, a French cardinal
attacked his venerated master in the presence of the Pope
and denied him the title of "Phœnix of Poets" that was
ordinarily given him, Boccaccio replied with an apology
in his favour.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Nor was this all, for it was mainly by
Boccaccio's efforts that that very disappointing poem
the <cite>Africa</cite> was preserved to us; and indeed, such was his
delight in Petrarch, that he arranged in order in a book
the letters he had received from him, for he thought himself
assured of immortality rather by them than by his
own works.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>It is indeed strange and lovely to come upon Boccaccio's
extraordinary modesty: the greatest prose-writer in the
Italian language, the greatest story-teller in the world,
considered himself of no account at all beside the pedantic
lover of Laura, the author of the <cite>Africa</cite> which he had not
seen. The very thought of comparing himself with
Petrarch seemed to him a crime. He considered him as
not altogether of this world; he dwelt, according to his
friend, in a superior region; and as for his work, his
writings, his style, they are marvellous and ornate, abounding
in sublime thoughts and exquisite expressions, for he
only wrote after long reflection, and he drew his thoughts
from the depths of his spirit.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> And when Petrarch
honoured him with the title of Poet, he declined it;<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> his
ideal was "to follow very modestly the footsteps of his
Silvanus."</p>

<p>"The illustrious Francesco Petrarca," he writes in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>another place,<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> "neglecting the precepts of certain writers
who scarcely attain to the threshold of poetry, began to
take the way of antiquity with so much force of character,
with such enthusiasm and perspicacity, that no obstacle
would arrest him, nor could ridicule turn him from his
way. Far from that, breaking through and tearing away
the brambles and bushes with which by the negligence
of men the road was covered, and remaking a solid road
of the rocks heaped up and made impassable by inundations,
he opened a passage for himself and for those who
would come after him. Then, cleansing the fountain of
Helicon from slime and rushes, he restored to the waters
their first chastity and sweetness. He opened the fount
of Castalia, hidden by wild branches, and cleared the grove
of laurels of thorns. Having established Apollo on his
throne, and restored to the Muses, disfigured by neglect
and rusticity, their ancient beauty, he climbed the highest
summits of Parnassus. And having been crowned with
a leafy garland by Daphne, he showed himself to the
Roman people, with the applause of the Senate, a thing
which had not been seen perhaps for more than a thousand
years. He forced the gates of the ancient Capitol, creaking
on their rusty hinges, and to the great joy of the
Romans he made their annals famous by an unaccustomed
triumph. O glorious spectacle! O unforgettable act!
This man by his prodigious effort, by his work everywhere
famous, as though he commanded through the universe
the trumpet of Fame, sounded the name of Poetry, brought
back again by him from darkness into light. He re-awakened
in all generous spirits a hope almost lost till
then, and he made it to be seen&mdash;what most of us had
not believed&mdash;that Parnassus was still to be won, that her
summit was still to be dared...."</p>

<p>The enthusiasm, the unselfishness of that! But he
does not stop there. Petrarch is as admirable morally as
he is as an artist or as a scholar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
"Petrarch," he tells us,<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> "living from his youth up as
a celibate, had such a horror of the impurities of the
excess of love that for those who know him he is the best
example of honesty. A mortal enemy of liars, he detests
all vices. For he is a venerable sanctuary of truth,
and honours and joys in virtue, the model of Catholic
holiness. Pious, gentle, and full of devotion, he is so
modest that one might name him a second Parthenias
[i.e. Virgil]. He is too the glory of the poetic art. An
agreeable and eloquent orator, philosophy has for him
no secrets. His spirit is of a superhuman perspicacity;
his mind is tenacious and full of all knowledge that man
may have. It is for this reason that his writings, both in
prose and in verse, numerous as they are, shine so
brilliantly, breathe so much charm, are adorned with so
many flowers, enclosing in their words so sweet a harmony,
and in their thoughts an essence so marvellous
that one believes them the work of a divine genius rather
than the work of a man. In short he is assuredly more
than a man and far surpasses human powers. I am not
singing the praises of some ancient, long since dead. On
the contrary, I am speaking of the merits of a living man....
If you do not believe these words, you can go and
see him with your eyes. I do not fear that it will happen
to him as to so many famous men, as Claudius says,
'Their presence diminishes their reputation.' Rather I
affirm boldly that he surpasses his reputation. He is
distinguished by such dignity of character, by an eloquence
so charming, by an urbanity and old age so well ordered,
that one can say of him what Seneca said of Socrates,
that 'one learns more from his manners than from his
discourse.'"</p>

<p>In this enormous praise, in this humility, Petrarch does
not seem to have seen anything extraordinary; in fact he
seems to have taken it as the most natural thing in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>world. We gather that he considered it was to have much
regard for Boccaccio to let him hope for some little glory
after him.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> And we may suspect that he found in him a
friend after his own heart. He showed his gratitude by
addressing a number of letters to him and by leaving him
in his Will fifty florins of gold to buy a mantle to protect
him against the cold during the long and studious nights
of winter.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Boccaccio was ill when he heard of that benefaction
and the death of his beloved master. The letter
he then wrote in praise of the dead, his hand trembling
with emotion and weakness, his eyes full of tears, is
perhaps the most beautiful, if not the most touching,
document of their friendship.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And then, as we have already seen, the love of Boccaccio
for his master, his solicitude for his memory, did not cease
with Petrarch's death. His first thought was for the
<cite>Africa</cite> of which his master had made, in imitation of
Virgil perhaps, so great a mystery, and, as it was said, had
wished to burn it. Though he was as ignorant as others
of its contents, believing as he did in Petrarch, he was
altogether convinced that it was a great and marvellous
poem, worthy of Homer and full of a divine inspiration.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
While some said Petrarch had left instructions to burn it,
others declared that he had appointed a commission to
decide whether it should live or die. Boccaccio does not
seem to have thought that he himself would necessarily
have been on any such commission; but immediately
addressed a supplication in verse to the tribunal, which
he feared would be composed of lawyers, demanding in
the name of the Muses, of kings, of peoples, of cities that
this masterpiece should not be allowed to perish.</p>

<p>So Boccaccio loved Petrarch. And that Petrarch was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>good for him, as we might say, who can doubt after reading
that noble letter on the vision of the Blessed Pietro? But
that Boccaccio was intellectually altogether at his mercy
unhappily we cannot doubt either after reading his Latin
works. He follows Petrarch so far as he can, but nearly
always blindly, exaggerating the predilections or prejudices
of his master even in little things. In all his works in
Latin he makes no allusion to his works in the vulgar:
Petrarch often mentions his, but always with an affected
disdain. Yet Boccaccio was by no means destitute of a
passion for literary glory. He desired it as eagerly as
Petrarch, but more modestly; and following the precept of
his master to the letter, he does not believe he can attain
to it by any other means than by classical studies. Like
his master too, he regretted the writings of his youth, and
would have destroyed them if they had not been spread
through all Italy and well out of his reach. In all these
things Boccaccio is but the follower of Petrarch, and
nothing can be more to the point than to compare them,
not indeed as artists, but as students, as scholars, as
philosophers.</p>

<p>And here let us admit, to begin with, that as a student,
as a man of culture, in a sense of the reality of history and
in a due sense of the proportion of things, Petrarch is as
much Boccaccio's superior as Boccaccio is Petrarch's as a
creative artist. For Petrarch antiquity was a practical
school of life. Convinced of the superiority of his spirit, he
possessed himself of what he read and assimilated what he
wanted.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> Boccaccio, on the other hand, remained entirely
outside, and can claim no merit as a scholar but that of
industry. As a student he is a mere compiler. His continual
ambition is to extend his knowledge, but Petrarch
dreams only of making his more profound. He too in
reading the ancients has collected an incalculable number
of extracts, but after putting them in order from various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
points of view he has only begun; he proceeds to draw
from them his own works.</p>

<p>Nor is Petrarch deceived in his own superiority. He
was by far the most cultured man of his time; as a critic
he had already for himself disposed of the much-abused
claims of the Church and the Empire. For instance, with
what assurance he recognises as pure invention, with what
certainty he annihilates with his criticism the privileges
the Austrians claimed to hold from Cæsar and Nero.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>
And even face to face with antiquity he is not afraid; he
is sure of the integrity of his mind; he analyses and
weighs, yes, already in a just balance, the opinions of
the writers of antiquity; while Boccaccio mixes up in the
most extraordinary way the various antiquities of all
sorts of epochs. Nor has Boccaccio the courage of his
opinions; all seems to him worthy of faith, of acceptance.
He cannot, even in an elementary way, discern the false
from the true; and even when he seems on the point of
doing so he has not the courage to express himself. When
he reads in Vincent de Beauvais that the Franks came
from Franc the son of Hector, he does not accept it
altogether, it is true, but, on the other hand, he dare not
deny it, "because nothing is impossible to the omnipotence
of God."<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> He accepts the gods and heroes of antiquity;
the characters in Homer and the writers of Greece, of
Rome, are equally real, equally authentic, equally worthy
of faith, and we might add equally unintelligible. They
are as wonderful, as delightful, as impossible to judge as
the saints. What they do or say he accepts with the same
credulity as that with which he accepted the visions of
Blessed Pietro. Petrarch only had to look Blessed Pietro
in the eye, and he shrivelled up into lies and absurdities.
But to dispose of a charlatan and a rascal of one's own day
is comparatively easy: the true superiority of Petrarch is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>shown when he is face to face with the realities of antiquity&mdash;when,
for instance, venerating Cicero as he did, he does
not hesitate to blame him on a question of morals. But
Boccaccio speaks of Cicero as though he scarcely knew
him;<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> he praises him as though he were a mere abstraction,
calls him "a divine spirit," a "luminous star whose
light still waxes."<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> He does not know him. He goes to
him for certain details because Petrarch has told him to
do so.</p>

<p>The truth seems to be that as soon as Boccaccio was
separated from life he became a nonentity. If this is not
so, how are we to explain the fact that he who was utterly
incapable of criticism, of any sense of difference or proportion
in regard to the ancients, could appreciate Petrarch so
exquisitely, not only as a writer, where he is often at sea,
but as a man? He has a philosophy of life, but he cannot
apply it to antiquity because he cannot realise antiquity.
Nor does he perceive that Petrarch is continually opposing
the philosophy of life to the philosophy of the schools.
It is true he defends Petrarch against the more obvious
absurdities of scholastic philosophy; but, like his opponents,
philosophy for him is nothing but the trick, we
cannot say the art, of reasoning, of dialectic.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> While
Petrarch with an immense and admirable courage bravely
dares to attack the tyranny of Aristotle in the world of
thought, he remains for Boccaccio "the most worthy
authority in all things of importance."<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> And so, for
example, when Aristotle affirms that the founders of
religion were the poets, Boccaccio does not hesitate to
oppose this theory to the theologians of his time.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Where
in fact Petrarch shows himself really superior to the vulgar
prejudices of his time his disciple cannot follow him. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>instance, in regard to astrology: Boccaccio attributed an
immense importance to it, but Petrarch never misses a
chance of ridiculing it even in his letters to Boccaccio.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
Nevertheless Boccaccio remains persuaded that the art of
astrology combines in itself much truth, and at any rate
rests on a solid basis. If it sometimes deceives us, we
must seek the cause in the greatness of the heavens, so
difficult to explore, and in the imperfect knowledge we
have of the movements and conjunctions of the planets.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>In all these things and in many others Boccaccio is little
more than Petrarch's disciple, following him without discrimination,
more violent in his abuse, more extreme in
his advocacy of those things or professions or ideas or
people whom his master had come to consider bad or
good, reasonable or unreasonable. And it is in the Latin
works that we find him most a disciple, really obeying
orders that he has by no means understood, compiling
with an immense and heroic labour a vast collection of
facts or supposed facts which have no relation to one
another, and reformed and revivified by no composing or
commanding idea, are for the most part just a heap of
dead and grotesque extravagances that for us at least can
have no meaning.</p>

<p>Let me confess it at once: after labouring with an
immense weariness through the whole of these works
in Latin, I have found but one complete work and
two fragments which seem to have been written with any
personal conviction: the <cite>Eclogues</cite>, parts of the <cite>De Montibus</cite>,
and the fourteenth book of the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Genealogiis Deorum</cite>.
The rest are vast compilations, made, one cannot say without
enthusiasm, for nothing but an immense enthusiasm
could have carried him through such a labour, but without
any unifying idea, without personal conviction or art or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>delight. They are the notebooks of an omnivorous but
indiscreet and undiscerning reader.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>The earliest among them, as we may think,<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> the <cite>De
Claris Mulieribus</cite>, constitutes as it were the transition
from the writings full of imagination and life in the vulgar
tongue to the works of erudition. Its chief purpose
would seem to be rather to entertain and to amuse women
than to write history or biography, and though now and
then a more serious idea might seem to discover itself,
it remains for the most part a wretched and awkward
piece of work, in which virtue and vice are dealt with and
distinguished, if at all, to hide the droll pleasantries which
are intended to divert the reader. In this Boccaccio was
successful, and the book had a great vogue in spite of its
absurdity.<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>The idea of the work was, as he confesses in the proem
suggested to him by Petrarch's <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Viris Illustribus</cite>. Ordered
chronologically, beginning with Eve, much space is given
to women of antiquity&mdash;Greek, Roman, and Barbarian,
little to Jewesses and Christians, saints and martyrs,
because, says Boccaccio, "I wish to spare them the
neighbourhood of Pagans." He has little to say either, of
the women of his own and the preceding age. He mentions,
however, Pope Joan, the virtuous Gualdrada,<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> the
Empress Constance, mother of Frederic II, and Queen
Giovanna of Naples, whom he praises for her personality
and character as one of the most remarkable women of his
time.</p>

<p>But it is in dealing with the more modern characters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>that he dates his work for us. We find there the same
contempt for, the same aversion from women in general as
have already come upon in the <cite>Corbaccio</cite> and the <cite>Vita
di Dante</cite>. It is possible that his contempt in some sort
excuses, or at least explains, the wretchedness of this
work. For if it was written for women, we know that he
considered that culture and learning were not only useless
to women, but even harmful, since they helped them to
evil. And he himself tells us with the most amazing humour
or effrontery that he has composed this work "less with a
view to general usefulness than for the greater honour of
the sex,"<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> yet, as we shall see, he abuses women roundly
on almost every possible occasion, and introduces a tale
like that of Paolina, which would not be out of place
in the <cite>Decameron</cite>.</p>

<p>"Paolina, the Roman lady," says Boccaccio, "lived in the
reign of Tiberius Cæsar, and above all the ladies of her
time she was famous for the beauty of her body and the
loveliness of her face, and, married as she was, she was
reputed the especial mirror of modesty. She cared for
nothing else, she studied no other thing, save to please her
husband and to worship and reverence Anubis, god of
the Egyptians, for whom she had so much devotion, that
in everything she did she hoped to merit his grace whom
she so much venerated. But, as we know, wherever there
is a beautiful woman there are young men who would be her
lovers, and especially if she be reputed chaste and honest,
so here a young Roman fell in love beyond hope of redemption
with the beautiful Paolina. His name was
Mundo, he was very rich, and of the noblest family in
Rome. He followed her with his eyes, and with much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
amorous and humble service as lovers are wont to do, and
with prayers too, and with promises and presents, but he
found her not to be won, for that she, modest and pure as
she was, placed all her affection in her husband, and
considered all those words and promises as nothing but
air. Mundo, seeing all this, almost hopeless at last, turned
all his thoughts to wickedness and fraud."</p>

<p>"It seems that Paolina used to visit almost every day
the Temple of Isis, where, with continual oblations and
sacred offerings, she worshipped and honoured the god
Anubis with the greatest devotion; which, when the young
man knew of it, love showed him a way, and he thought and
imagined in his heart an unheard-of evil. Telling himself
then that the priests and ministers of Anubis would be
able to assist and favour his desires, he went to them, and
after many prayers and many rich gifts opened to them
the matter. And it happened as he wished. For when
Paolina next came to the temple the most venerable high
priest himself, in a quiet and humble voice, told her that
the god Anubis had appeared to him in the night and had
bidden him say to her that he, Anubis himself, was well
pleased and delighted with her devotion, and that in that
temple where she worshipped him he would, for her good
and repose of heart, speak with her in the darkness of
night. Now when Paolina heard this from so venerable a
priest, judging that this had come to her though her
devotion and holiness, she rejoiced without measure at the
words, and returning home told all to her husband, who,
like a fool, believing all to be true, consented that she
should spend the following night in the temple. And so
it befell at nightfall Paolina came to the preordained
place, and after solemn ceremonies and holy prayers
alone she entered the rich bed to await Anubis, the god of
her devotion. And when she had fallen asleep, came,
introduced by the priests, Mundo, covered with the vestments
and ornaments of Anubis and full of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>ardent desire; then with a soft voice, taking her in his
arms, he awakened her.<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> And Mundo, in the voice of
Anubis, seeing her afraid and confused at first waking,
bade her be of good heart, saying that he was Anubis whom
she had for so long venerated and worshipped, and that he
was come from heaven because of her prayers and devotions
that he might lie with her, and of her have a son a
god like to himself. Which, when Paolina heard, before all
else she asked if it were the custom of the supernal powers
to mix themselves with mortals; to whom Mundo
answered, even so, and gave the example of Jove, who had
descended from heaven and passed through the roof where
Danäe lay, into her lap, from which intercourse Perseus,
now in heaven, was born. And hearing this Paolina most
joyfully consented. Then Mundo, all naked, entered into
the bed of Anubis, and so won the desired embraces and
kisses and pleasures; and when it was dawn he left her,
saying that she had that night conceived a son. And when
it was day Paolina arose, and, carried by the priests,
returned to her house, believing everything and recounting
all to her foolish husband, who received his wife joyfully
with the greatest honour, thinking that she would be
the mother of a god. Nor would either have doubted this
but for the want of caution on the part of the too ardent
Mundo. For it seemed to him that Paolina had returned
his embraces with the greatest readiness and delight,
and thinking therefore that he had conquered her modesty
and hoping to enjoy her again, he went to her one day in
the temple, and coming close to her whispered, 'Blessed art
thou who hast conceived of the god Anubis.' But the
result was quite other than he had expected. For stupefied
beyond measure, Paolina, bringing all things to her remembrance
that had befallen on that night, understood the
fraud, and altogether broken-hearted told her husband,
opening all her thoughts; and he went immediately in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
greatest sorrow and distress to Tiberius Cæsar. And
Cæsar ordered that all the priests should be slain with
grievous torments, and that Mundo should be sent into
exile; and as for the simple and deceived Paolina, she
became the laughing-stock of the Roman people."</p>

<p>Such is one of the stories of the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Claris Mulieribus</cite>.
But though it be one of the best tales there, and indeed we
may compare it with a famous story in the <cite>Decameron</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> it
is by no means characteristic of the whole book, which has
its more serious side, for Boccaccio uses his facts, his
supposed facts, often enough to admonish his contemporaries,
and therefore to some extent the work may be said
to have had a moral purpose.</p>

<p>Yet after all, what chiefly interests us in an inferior piece
of work is the view of woman we find there. And
strangely enough, in this book so full of mere foolishness
and unhappy scolding we find a purer and more splendid
praise of woman than anywhere else in his work. "A
woman," he tells us, "can remain pure in the midst of
corruptions and every horror and vice as a ray of sunlight
remains pure even when it falls on a filthy puddle." Yes,
they can do so, and that he admits it, is at least something,
but if we may judge from this book it was by no means
his opinion that commonly they do. For he is always
pointing in scorn at the women of his time. He tells of
the death of Seneca's wife, who killed herself that she
might not survive her husband, in order that he may
preach to the widows of his day, who do not hesitate,
we learn, to remarry, "not twice nor thrice, but five or six
times." Again, he tells the story of Dido more according
to the legends that had grown up around it than according
to the <cite>Æneid</cite>, in order that it may be an example "above
all among Christians" to those widows who take a third or
fourth husband.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Having been betrayed by a widow, he is
as personally suspicious of and vindictive against them as
the elder Mr. Weller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>Nor is he sparing in his abuse of women in general.
They can only keep a secret of which they are ignorant, he
tells us. And like many men who have lived disorderly,
he puts an extraordinary, a false, value on chastity. For
after recommending all parents to bring up their daughters
chastely, which is sane and right, he bids women guard
their chastity even to the death, adding that they should
prefer a certain death to an uncertain dishonour.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> And
after giving more than one example to bear this out, he
cites the women of the Cimbri, who, when their husbands
fled, besought the Romans to let them enter the house of
the Vestals, and when this was denied them killed themselves
after murdering their children. Nor does he ever
cease to deplore the luxury and coquetry of women, blaming
the Roman Senate when, in honour of Volumnia, mother
of Coriolanus, who had saved the Republic, it allowed
matrons to wear earrings. For luxury, says he, is the ruin
of women, and so of men also, for the world belongs to
men, but men to women.</p>

<p>Again and again he returns to the attitude he assumed
in the <cite>Decameron</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> but without its gaiety. Man is the
more perfect and the firmer and stronger: how then can
a woman do else but yield to her lover? If there are
exceptions it is because some women partake of the
nature of man, Sulpicia, for instance, who was, he says,
"rather a man than a woman," and indeed some women
have a man's soul in a woman's body. Nor does he
omit any sort or kind of temperament. He shows us
the courageous woman in Sofonisba, the voluptuous in
Cleopatra, the chaste in Gualdrada, the simple in Paolina,
the proud in Zenobia, the resigned in Costanza, the wise
in Proba, the intriguer in Poppea, the generous in Sempronia.<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
He writes three hundred lives, and in every one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>we find the same sentiments of passionate interest, suspicion,
distrust. If it were possible to gather from this
vast depository the type of woman Boccaccio himself
preferred, we should find, I think, that she was by no
means the intelligent, learned, energetic, independent, and
strong-willed woman that negatively, as it were, he praises,
for to him she would seem not a woman but a kind of
man. No, he remains to worship the beautiful, subtle,
credulous, and distracting creature that he had found in
that Fiammetta who had betrayed him,&mdash;in two minds
during a single heart's beat, cruel and sensual too, eager
to love and without responsibility, afraid of the dark, but
ready to do anything in things to her mind; in fact, the
abused heroine of all his books. But while he adores her,
he makes fun of her, he scorns her, he curses her, he hates
her, yet in a moment she will be in his arms.</p>

<p>It was to one such he thought to dedicate this book of
Famous Ladies,<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> to that Queen Giovanna of Naples, the
granddaughter of King Robert the Wise, who had been
the father of his own Fiammetta. But in the last chapter
of the book, which is a long panegyric in her honour,
he praises her not as a woman but as a great and powerful
king. We do not know, alas! what he really thought
of her, for eager Guelf and Angevine as he always was, he
would be the last to tell us the truth, if it were evil, about
this unhappy lady, and here at least his work is so full
of praise that there is no room for judgment. If he had
once spoken evil of her<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> he has here made amends, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>in such a way that we are in no way enlightened and
remain as always at the mercy of the chroniclers.<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p>If we needed any evidence other than the works themselves
that these compilations in Latin worried and bored
Boccaccio, we should find it in the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Casibus Virorum</cite>, a vast
work in nine books, which was taken up and put aside in
disgust not less than three times, and at last only completed
by the continual urgings of Petrarch, who, not
understanding the disgust of the creative artist for this
kind of book-making, was reduced to reply to the protests
of Boccaccio that "man was born for labour."<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> The <cite>De
Casibus Virorum</cite> is certainly a more considerable work
than the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Claris Mulieribus</cite>, but it is without the occasional
liveliness of the earlier work, as we see it, for
instance, in the story of Paolina, and is in fact merely an
enormous compilation, as I have said, made directly under
the influence of Petrarch, who, in imitation of the ancients,
was always willing to discourse concerning the instability
of Fortune. It was a theme which suited his peculiar
genius, and in the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Viris Illustribus</cite> and the <cite>De Remediis
Utriusque Fortunæ</cite> we see him at his best in this manner.<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
But for Boccaccio such moralising became a mere drudgery,
a mere heaping together of what he had read but not
digested. Eager to follow in Petrarch's footsteps, however,
he took up the same theme as the subject of an historical
work, in which he sets out to show the misfortunes of famous
men. Beginning with Adam and Eve&mdash;for he admits a few
women&mdash;he passes in review with an enormous languor
that makes the book one of the most wearying in all
literature the personages of fable and legend and history,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>treating all alike, down to his own time. Sometimes
he is merely dull, sometimes absurd, sometimes
theatrical, but always lifeless in these accounts of the
tragic ends of "Famous Men" or of their fall from power.
He is never simple, nor does he take his work simply; by
every trick he had used in his creative work he tries in
vain to give this book some sort of life. He sees his
characters in vision, then, in imitation of Petrarch, he
interrupts the narrative to preach, to set down tedious
moral sentiments&mdash;that bad habit of his old age&mdash;or
philosophical conclusions, or to lose himself in long
digressions upon a thousand and one subjects&mdash;on riches,
on fortune, on happiness, on rhetoric, on the lamentable
condition of Rome, on the sadness (acedia) of writers, of
which Petrarch had cured him, or again in defence of
poetry, never choosing a subject, however, that had not
been already treated by Petrarch, except it be woman,
whom he again attacks, more soberly perhaps, but infinitely
more tediously, warning us against her wiles in the manner
of a very minor prophet. As long as he is a mere historian,
a mere compiler, a mere scholar, he remains almost
unreadable, but as soon as he returns to life, to what he
has seen with his own eyes, even in this uncouth jargon,
this Church Latin, he becomes an artist, a man of letters,
and we find then without surprise that one of the last
episodes he recounts, the history of Filippa la Catanese
was, even in the seventeenth century, still read apparently
with the greatest delight, for very many editions were
published of this fragment of his book, of which I have
already spoken.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Certainly the most original and probably the best of
Boccaccio's Latin works in prose is the <cite>De Genealogiis
Deorum</cite>, with which is generally printed the <cite>De Montibus</cite>,
<cite>Sylvis</cite>, etc. The first, however, is really but a mass of
facts and confused details quite undigested and set forth
without any unity, while the latter is an alphabetical
dictionary of ancient geography to assist those who read
the Latin poets.<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> At the time these books appeared, however,
such matters were a novelty, and we have in them
the first complete manual of an ancient science and
the first dictionary of geography of the modern world.
I say of the modern world, yet though we cannot but
admire their erudition and the patient research of the
author, these do not suffice to place these works really
above the meagre compilations of the Middle Age,<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> yet
we find there perhaps a change of method which
makes them important. Both books are, however, full of
credulities, they altogether lack judgment and any system,
and can therefore scarcely be said to belong to humanism.</p>

<p>In the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Genealogiis Deorum</cite> Boccaccio gathers every
mythological story he can find, and would explain them
all by means of symbols and allegories, and in doing this
he very naturally provoked the fervent applause of his
contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> But what renders the volume really
interesting and valuable to us is the eager and passionate
defence of poetry which forms its epilogue.</p>

<p>Boccaccio had always fought valiantly in defence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>"poetry," by which he understood the art of literature, and
the new learning, the knowledge of antiquity. This art,
for it was by no means yet a science, had many more
enemies than friends. To a great extent Petrarch refused
to meet these foes, considering them as beneath his
notice; it was left for Boccaccio to defend not only letters,
but Petrarch and his Muse. To this defence he consecrates
two whole books of the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Genealogiis Deorum</cite>, the
fourteenth and fifteenth, and there he takes under his
protection not only the poets of antiquity, but poetry in
general and his own occupation with mythology. He
pounds away with much success at the scholastic philosophers
and theologians, who had no idea that they were
already dead and damned, and while they declared poetry
to be a sheer tissue of fables he busily dug their graves or
heaped earth upon them. He left really nothing undone.
He attacked their morality, and where so much was an
absurdity of lies that was easy; but he appealed too to
S. Augustine and S. Jerome, which was dangerous;<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> and
at last, somewhat embarrassed by certain Latin poets who
had proved to be too involved in their frivolity to defend,
he abandoned them to their fate, reluctantly, it is true, but
he abandoned them, and among these were Plautus, Terence,
whom he had copied with his own hand, and Ovid,
who had been the companion of his youth. The men
whom Petrarch refused to touch lest he should soil his
hands had to be content with these.</p>

<p>In Boccaccio's definition of the poet, which owed very
much to Petrarch we may think, he comprehended the
philosopher, the mystic, the prophet&mdash;especially the
mystic; for he is much concerned with allegory and
the hidden meaning of words. For him the work of the
poet, and truly, is with words, but with words only. He
must find new material if he can it is true, but, above all,
he must dress it in long-sought-out words and rhythms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
that shall at once hide and display the real meaning.
He seems to leave nothing to the moment, to spontaneous
feeling. The true mistress of the poet does not enter into
his calculations; yet there is more spontaneity in the
<cite>Decameron</cite> than in all Petrarch's work. Still he lays stress
on that truly Latin gift, the power to describe or contrive
a situation which will hold and excite men.</p>

<p>What he most strongly insists upon, however, is the
hidden meaning of the ancient poets. He declares that
only a fool can fail to see allegories in the works of
antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> One must be mad not to see, in the <cite>Bucolics</cite>,
the <cite>Georgics</cite>, and the <cite>Æneid</cite> of Virgil, allegories, though
we may not certainly read them.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> Is it not thus, he asks,
that Dante has hidden in the <cite>Comedy</cite> the mysteries of the
Catholic religion? Are there not allegories in the work
of his master Petrarch?<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>He turns from Petrarch to Homer, whom he declares he
has always by him. He speaks of Pilatus, to whom he
says he owes much: "A little man but great in learning,
so deep in the study of great matters that emperors and
princes bore witness that none as learned as he had
appeared for many centuries." He closes the book with
an appeal to Ugo, King of Cyprus and Jerusalem, who
had begged him to write this work, which is a truly
marvellous cyclopædia of learning and mythology, with
this defence of poetry and poets added to it in the two last
books, which are later than the rest.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>It is not, however, in the <cite>De Genealogiis</cite> but in the <cite>De
Montibus, Sylvis, Lacubus, Fluminibus, Stagnis seu Paludis,
de Nominibus Maris</cite> that we have the true type of these
works. They are all really dictionaries of learning and
legend, but it is only this that is actually in the form of
a dictionary, the various subjects being set forth and
described in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>The enormous popularity of these works in their day
is witnessed by the numerous editions through which
they passed both in Latin and Italian in Italy and abroad.
They were the textbooks of the early Renaissance, and
we owe Boccaccio, as one of the great leaders of that
movement, all the gratitude we can give him; all the more
that the work he began has been so fruitful that we can
scarcely tolerate the works that guided its first steps.</p>

<cite>COMENTO</cite></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">In</span> the summer of the year 1373 when Boccaccio was
sixty years old the Signoria of Florence was
petitioned by a number of citizens to appoint a
lecturer who should publicly expound "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">librum qui
vulgariter appellatur el Dante</span>," the work which is commonly
called "el Dante," the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, that is to say,
the work of one who little by little was coming to be
known as a very great poet, as a very great man, but who
more than seventy years before had been ignominiously
expelled from Florence and had died in exile.</p>

<p>The petition, a copy of which may still be found in the
Florentine <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Libro delle Provvisioni</cite> for 1373, is as follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

"Whereas divers citizens of Florence, being minded as
well for themselves and others, their fellow-citizens, as for
their posterity, to follow after virtue, are desirous of being
instructed in the book of Dante, wherefrom, both to the
shunning of vice and to the acquisition of virtue, no less
than in the ornaments of eloquence, even the unlearned
may receive instruction; The said citizens humbly pray
you, the worshipful Government of the People and
Commonwealth of Florence, that you be pleased, at a
fitting time, to provide and formally to determine, that
a worthy and learned man, well versed in the knowledge
of the poem aforesaid, shall be by you elected, for such
term as you may appoint, being not longer than one year,
to read the book which is commonly called <i>el Dante</i> in
the city of Florence, to all such as shall be desirous of
hearing him, on consecutive days, not being holidays,
and in consecutive lectures, as is customary in like cases;
and with such salary as you may determine, not exceeding
the sum of one hundred gold florins for the said
year, and in such manner and under such conditions as
may seem proper to you; and further that the said salary
be paid to the said lecturer from the funds of the
Commonwealth in two terminal payments, to wit, one
moiety about the end of the month of December, and the
other moiety about the end of the month of April, such
sum to be free of all deduction for taxes whatsoever...."</p>

</div>

<p>The petition was favourably considered by the Signoria
on August 9, and was put to the vote of the assembly.
Two hundred and five persons voted in all, one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>and eighty-six in its favour, and nineteen against it.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> The
voting was by ballot and secret, and no names have come
down to us, but it is perhaps permitted us to suppose, as
Mr. Toynbee suggests, that the opposition came from
those whose ancestors, whose fathers and grandfathers,
Dante had placed in Hell, or had otherwise insulted and
condemned. The decision come to on August 9 was
carried on the 25th, when the Signoria appointed "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominus
Johannes de Certaldo, honorabilis civis Florentinus</span>," to
lecture on the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite><a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> for a year from the 18th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>October at a salary of one hundred gold florins, half of
which, as the petition had suggested, was paid to him on
December 31, 1373.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> And on Sunday, October 23, 1373,<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
Boccaccio delivered his first lecture in S. Stefano della
Badia.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>In thus appointing Boccaccio to the first <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cathedra
Dantesca</i> that had anywhere been established, the Signoria
not only in some sort made official amends for the cruel
sentence by which the greatest son of Florence had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>proclaimed and exiled,<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> but they also showed their goodwill
by choosing for lecturer the man who above all others
was best fitted to expound his work and to defend his
memory.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, Boccaccio had been an eager
student of Dante in the first years of his literary life.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> It
is probable that he was first introduced to Dante's work by
Cino da Pistoja, whom he seems to have met in Naples
between October, 1330, and July, 1331,<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> and in his first
book, the <cite>Filocolo</cite>, he imitates and speaks of him;<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> in the
<cite>Filostrato</cite> he copies him so closely that in fact he quotes
from him;<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> in the <cite>Rime</cite> he not only, to a large extent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>models his work on the sonnets of Dante, but he appeals to
him and mentions his name more than once, in one case,
in the sonnet already quoted addressed to Dante in
Paradise after the death of Fiammetta, certainly before
the <cite>Vita</cite> was written or the lectures begun.</p>

allegory of the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> This was in 1355, and
immediately after the completion of the <cite>Corbaccio</cite> we find
him at work, about 1356-7, on the <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita di Dante</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> About
this time too he seems to have begun to copy the <cite>Divine
Comedy</cite><a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> with his own hand in order to send it to Petrarch,
and we may understand perhaps how great a pioneer he
was in the appreciation of Dante when from that fact we
learn that Petrarch had no copy in his library. With this
MS. in his own hand he sent a <i>Carme</i> to Petrarch of forty
lines written in Latin in praise of Dante,<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> and before 1359
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>he evidently wrote to Petrarch excusing himself for his
enthusiastic praise of Dante. That letter is unfortunately
lost, but happily we have Petrarch's answer, in which he
most unsuccessfully tries to excuse himself for his coldness
towards the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, and indeed attempts to
set the charge aside.</p>

<p>"In your letter," he writes in 1359,<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> "there are many
things that need no answer, for instance those of which
we have lately spoken face to face. But there are two
besides, which I have singled out, and these I do not wish
to pass over in silence.... Firstly, then, you excuse
yourself with some eagerness for having been so prodigal
in your praise of our countryman, a poet for the people
assuredly as to his style,<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> yet undoubtedly noble if one
consider the subject of which he writes. But you seek
to justify yourself as though I might see in your praise of
him or another a stain on my own reputation. You say
too that all the praise you give him&mdash;if I look at it
closely&mdash;turns to my glory. And you excuse too yourself
by saying that in your youth he was the first guide,
the first light in your studies. Well, then, you are acting
with justice, with gratitude, in not forgetting him, and in
short, with piety. If we owe everything to those who
have given us life, if we owe much to those who have
enriched us, what do we not owe to those who have
nurtured and formed our spirits? Those who have cultivated
our souls have indeed greater titles to our remembrance
than those who have cared for our bodies....
Courage, then; I not only permit you, I invite you to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>celebrate and to honour this torch of your mind who has
given you of his heat and of his light in this path along
which you pass towards a glorious goal. It has been long
blown upon and, so to say, wearied by the windy applause
of the vulgar, and I bid you elevate it then even to the
heaven by true praises worthy of him and of yourself.
Such will be pleasing to me, because he is worthy of this
commendation and, as you say, it is for you a duty. I
approve then your commendatory verses,<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> and in my turn
I crown with praise the poet you commend.</p>

<p>But in your letter of excuse the only thing that has
really hurt me is to see how little you know me even now;
yet I thought you at least knew me altogether. What is
this? You think I should not rejoice, that I should not
even glory in the praise of illustrious men? But believe
me, nothing is stranger to my character than envy, nothing
is more unknown...."</p>

<p>Perhaps Petrarch protests too much. Yet one may well
think that, noble as he was, he was at least above envying
Dante Alighieri, for he knew very little about him, and
sincerely thought him of small account since his greatest
work was written not in Latin, the tongue as he so wonderfully
thought absolutely necessary to immortality, but in
the sweeter and lovelier "Florentine idiom," the "glory" of
which, as Boccaccio had already said in the <cite>Vita</cite>, Dante
had revealed.</p>

<p>Thus all his life long we see Boccaccio as the enthusiastic
lover and defender of the greatest of Italian poets,
gently protesting against Petrarch's neglect of him, passionately
protesting against the treatment "Florence, noblest
among all the cities of Italy," had measured out to him,
fiercely contemptuous of "those witless ones," priests and
the scholastics, who considered his works to be "vain and
silly fables or marvels," and could not perceive that "they
have concealed within them the sweetest fruits of historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
or philosophical truth." Indeed, alone among his
contemporaries he values the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> at its true
worth and for the right reasons. Nor in fact should we
know half we do know concerning Dante&mdash;much more that
is than we know of Chaucer and Shakespeare, for instance&mdash;if
Boccaccio had not loved him and shared, as he says,
"the general debt to his honour" in so far as he could, "that
is to say in letters, poor though they be for so great a task.
But hereof I have, hereof I will give; lest foreign peoples
should have power to say that his fatherland had been alike
unthankful to so great a poet, whether taken generally or
man by man."</p>

<p>It has become the fashion of late, and yet maybe it was
always so, to sneer at, to doubt and to find fault with
Boccaccio's <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita di Dante</cite><a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> in season and out of season on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
all possible points, and on some that are impossible.
Scholars of Dante generally, with some eminent exceptions,
seem to consider it a kind of impertinence in the author of
the <cite>Decameron</cite> to have interested himself in Dante.</p>

<p>Mr. Wicksteed, for instance, to whom we owe a charming
translation of the <cite>Vita</cite><a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>&mdash;so charming and so full of
Boccaccio's own flavour that in all modesty I have taken
leave to use it when I must&mdash;though he is himself its
translator, finds it necessary not so much to commend it to
us as to give us "some needful warnings" and "further
cautions" in introducing us to it. He nowhere, I think,
tells us how very valuable it is, nor instructs us why above
all other works of the kind it is valuable to us. He
nowhere takes the trouble to tell his readers that Boccaccio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
was the most eminent student of Dante in his day&mdash;the
years that immediately followed the poet's death&mdash;nor that
he must have met and talked with many who had known
Dante. He nowhere thinks it necessary to record that
Boccaccio spent more than one considerable period of time
in Romagna and the Marche, and even in the very city and
at the same court where Dante lived and died. It did not
occur to him as a point of honour before giving us his
"warnings" and "cautions" to state that Boccaccio was
well acquainted with Dante's daughter Beatrice, nor to
mention that it was probably during a sojourn in Ravenna,
where she was a nun, that Boccaccio conceived, or at
any rate "pondered" the <cite>Vita</cite> itself.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> Mr. Wicksteed
does none of these things; but having spoken somewhat
vaguely of the "versions" of the <cite>Vita</cite> and still
more vaguely of its date, he proceeds to discuss its "documentary
value," assuring us a little reluctantly that
"scholars appear to be settling down to the conclusion
that ... [Boccaccio] is to be taken as a serious biographer,
who made careful investigations and who used the material
he had gathered with some degree of critical judgment."<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>It will be seen, then, that such scholars are right, and
that we have indeed in the <cite>Vita</cite> not only the earliest, but
incomparably the most authoritative life of Dante that
has come down to us, for it was written not merely by the
greatest lover and defender of Dante in the years that immediately
followed his death in 1321, but by one who was
then already a boy of eight years old, and who in his
manhood was well acquainted with Dante's daughter
Beatrice, and with others who had known him in Ravenna
and Romagna, where he had passed so much of his time.</p>

<p>The <cite>Vita</cite> then comes to us with a certain unassailable
authority, and is besides a work of piety, of love, of vindication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
It opens a little pedantically perhaps with an appeal
to Solon, that "temple of human wisdom," against the
policy of the Florentine Commonwealth in its failure to reward
the deserving and to punish the guilty. A passionate
attack on those who had exiled Dante follows in which
he demands: "If all the wrongs Florence hath wrought
could be hidden from the all-seeing eye of God, would not
this one alone suffice to call down His wrath upon her? Yea,
verily!" Then follows the reason for his book, which it
seems he has determined to write in expiation of the sin
of Florence, "recognising that I myself am a part, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
but a small one, of the same city whereof Dante Alighieri,
considering his deserts, his nobility, and his virtue, was a
very great one." His book will consist, he tells us, of "those
things as to which he [Dante] kept seemly silence concerning
himself, to wit, the nobility of his origin, his life,
his studies, and his character; and after that I will gather
together the works he composed; wherein he hath rendered
himself so illustrious amongst those to come...."
And he will write in the vulgar "in style full humble, and
light ... and in our Florentine idiom, that it may not
depart from what he used in the greater part of his works."
He returns more than once to praise the vulgar tongue,
praising Dante in one place as he who "was first to open the
way for the return of the Muses banished from Italy. It
was he who revealed the glory of the Florentine idiom.
It was he that brought under the rule of due numbers
every beauty of the vernacular speech. It was he who
may be truly said to have brought back dead poesy to
life." In another place he says: "by his teachings he
trained many scholars in poetry, especially in the vulgar,
which to my thinking he first exalted and brought into
repute among us Italians, no otherwise than did Homer
his amongst the Greeks or Virgil his amongst the Latins....
He showed by the effect that every lofty matter may
be treated in it; and made our vernacular glorious above
every other."</p>

<p>Having thus introduced his work to us, he proceeds to
speak of the birth of Dante, who, he says, was born in
1265.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> He speaks then of his "boyhood continuously
given to study in the liberal arts"; of his reading of
Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Statius; of his mastering history
"by himself," and philosophy under divers teachers by
long study and toil. He then tells us of his places of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
study, naming Florence, Bologna, and Paris.<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> He then
passes on to his meeting in his ninth year with Beatrice,
who, he tells us, was the little daughter of Folco Portinari,
and recounts her death in her twenty-fourth year and
Dante's grief, his relations' purpose to cure him by
giving him a wife, and his marriage with Gemma. There
follows the famous interpolation against marriage which
I have already quoted at length,<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> but which, as he confesses,
has nothing to do with Dante.</p>

<p>Having thus brought Dante to manhood, Boccaccio
speaks of his entrance into politics, "wherein the vain
honours that are attached to public office so entangled
him that, without considering whence he had departed
nor whither he was going, with loosened rein he gave
himself almost wholly up to the management of these
things; and therein fortune was so favourable to him that
never an embassy was heard nor answered, never a law
enacted nor cancelled, never a peace made, never a war
undertaken, and, in short, never a deliberation of any
weight conducted till he first had given his opinion
thereon." We are told of the factions into which the
city was divided, and how the faction opposed to that of
which Dante was in some sense the leader got the mastery
and "hurled Dante in a single moment from the height of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>government of his city," so that he was cast out from it an
exile, his house gutted and plundered, and his real property
confiscated.</p>

<p>He shows us the poet wandering hither and thither
through Tuscany "without anxiety" on account of his
wife and children, because he knew Gemma "to be
related to one of the chiefs of the hostile faction ...
and some little portion of his possessions she had with
difficulty defended from the rage of the citizens, under the
title of her dowry, on the proceeds of which she provided
in narrow style enough for herself and for his children;
whilst he in his poverty must needs provide for his own
sustenance by industry, to which he was all unused....
Year after year he remained (turning from Verona, where
he had gone to Messer Alberto della Scala on his first
flight, and had been graciously received by him), now with
the Count Salvatico in the Casentino, now with the
Marquis Moruello Malespina in the Lunigiana, now with
the Della Faggiola in the mountains near Urbino, held in
much honour so far as consisted with the times and with
their power." Thence Boccaccio tells us he went to
Bologna and Padua, and again to Verona. It was at
this time, seeing no way yet of returning to Florence,
that he went to Paris and there studied philosophy and
theology. While he was in Paris, Henry of Luxemburg
was elected King of the Romans and had left Germany
to subdue Italy. Dante "supposed for many reasons that
he must prove victorious, and conceived the hope of returning
to Florence by his power ... although he heard
Florence had taken sides against him." So he crossed
the Alps, "he joined with the enemies of the Florentines,
and both by embassies and letters strove to draw the
Emperor from the siege of Brescia in order to lay siege
to Florence ... declaring that if she were overcome,
little or no toil would remain to secure the possession and
dominion of all Italy free and unimpeded." This proved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>a failure, for Florence was not to be beaten, and the death
of the Emperor "cast into despair all who were looking
to him, and Dante most of all; wherefore no longer going
about to seek his return, he passed the heights of the
Apennines and departed to Romagna, where his last day
that was to put an end to all his toils awaited him." There
in Ravenna ruled Guido Novello da Polenta, who, as
Boccaccio says, "did not wait to be requested" to receive
him, "but considering with how great shame men of worth
ask such favours, with liberal mind and with free proffers
he approached him, requesting from Dante of special
grace that which he knew Dante must needs have begged
of him, to wit, that it might please him to abide with him....
Highly pleased by the liberality of the noble knight,
and also constrained by his necessities, Dante awaited
no further invitation but the first, and took his way to
Ravenna...." There in "the middle or thereabout of
his fifty-sixth year he fell sick ... and in the month of
September in the years of Christ one thousand three
hundred and twenty-one, on the day whereon the Exaltation
of the Holy Cross is celebrated by the Church, not
without the greatest grief on the part of the aforesaid
Guido, and generally all the other Ravennese, he rendered
up to his Creator his toilworn spirit, the which I doubt
not was received into the arms of his most noble Beatrice,
with whom ... he now lives most joyously in that life
the felicity of which expects no end." Then after speaking
of the plans of Guido for Dante's tomb, and again
reproaching Florence for her ingratitude, and inciting her
for her own honour to demand his body, "not but that I
am certain he will not be surrendered to thee," what we
may call the first part of the <cite>Vita</cite> comes to an end.</p>

<p>The second part opens with a portrait of the poet very
careful and minute in its description.</p>

<p>"This our poet, then, was of middle height; and when
he had reached maturity he went somewhat bowed, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
gait grave and gentle, and ever clad in most seemly apparel,
in such garb as befitted his ripe years. His face was long,
his nose aquiline, and his eyes rather large than small; his
jaws big, and the under lip protruding beyond the upper.
His complexion was dark, his hair and beard thick, black,
and curling, and his expression was ever melancholy and
thoughtful."<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> There follow several stories about him in
Verona and at Paris. And Boccaccio seems to have come
very near to the secret of Dante's tragedy when he tells us
at last that "he longed most ardently for honour and
glory; perchance more than befitted his illustrious virtue."
He understood the enormous pride of the man, his insatiable
superiority, his scorn of those who had wronged him;
and he is full of excuses for him, full of pity too for his
sorrows and eager to heap praise on praise of the great
poet he so much reverenced and loved.<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>The rest of the <cite>Vita</cite> is concerned with Dante's work,
and forms, as it were, a third part, introduced by a long
dissertation on poetry and poets, followed by a short
chapter on Dante's pride and some in which he gives
certain instances of it. Then he passes to the consideration
of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita Nuova</i>, of the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span><cite>De Monarchia</cite>, the <cite>Convivio</cite>, the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Vulgari Eloquentia</cite>,
and the <cite>Rime</cite> in the briefest possible manner. As a critic
it must be confessed Boccaccio is lacking in judgment, but
the facts he gives us, the assertions he makes in matters of
fact regarding these works must be received, I think, with
the utmost seriousness. It is impossible to doubt that
Boccaccio wrote in all good faith, and it must be remembered
that there were any number of people living who
had he departed from the truth could have contradicted
him. No one of whom we have any record did contradict
him; we hear no whisper of any protest. Most of those
who busied themselves with Dante, on the contrary, gladly
copied him. Had he been a liar with regard to Dante the
Republic of Florence would scarcely have appointed him
to the first <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cathedra Dantesca</i>; but they gave him the
lectureship just because he was the one person who could
fill it with honour.</p>

<p>And so when he tells us that in his maturer years
Dante was ashamed of the <cite>Vita Nuova</cite> we must accept
it, reminding ourselves that this was no impossibility,
for Petrarch too was ashamed of his Italian sonnets,
while Boccaccio actually destroyed a great part of his
own. When he tells us again that Dante left behind him
seven cantos of the <cite>Inferno</cite> when he fled from Florence,
we must accept it in the same way as we must accept the
story of the recovery of the last thirteen cantos of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span><cite>Paradiso</cite> by Dante's son Jacopo. Indeed, there is no good
reason to find Boccaccio either careless or a liar anywhere
in the work. The immense care he bestowed upon the
collection of his facts has, on the contrary, been admitted
by one of the best Dante scholars of our day<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> and proved
by another not less learned,<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> so that we have no right at all
to regard his work as anything less than the most valuable
document we possess on Dante's life. It has often been
treated as a mere romance, it has been sneered at and
abused, but it has never yet been proved to be at fault
in any matter of the least importance touching Dante, or in
any matter of personal fact. Of course it is not the work
of a modern historian; it has not the reassurance of dullness
or the mechanical accuracy of "scientific" history.
But to sneer at it because its "account of the Guelf and
Ghibelline disputes and of the political events in which
Dante was chiefly concerned" may seem "vague and
inadequate in the extreme" is merely absurd. Boccaccio
is not writing of these events, he does not propose to give
an account of them; he confesses in the most sincere
fashion that he does not rightly know what the words
Guelf and Ghibelline originally implied. He is writing of
Dante; and on Dante's life, on Dante's work, he had
enquired and studied and read and, as he himself says,
"pondered" for many years.</p>

<p>We must not demand from the <cite>Vita</cite> more than it
will readily give us. It was written with a purpose.
Its intention was both to praise Dante and to arrest the
attention of the Florentines to the wrong they had done
him; Boccaccio wished to set the facts before them
as an advocate of the dead. The facts: he had known
Beatrice, Dante's daughter, and three other relations or
friends of Dante's whom he names, Pier Giardino of
Ravenna,<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> one of Dante's most intimate friends; Andrea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>Poggio,<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> Dante's nephew, and Dino Perini, Andrea's rival
in the discovery of the lost cantos of the <cite>Inferno</cite>, and
many others who had known both Dante and Beatrice;<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
thus he could if he wished come by facts; and that he set
down just facts has been proved over and over again.
And then there were still living those who had hated
Dante bitterly and would gladly have found fault if they
could. There were others too who would certainly have
allowed nothing entirely to the detriment of Dante to pass
unchallenged: they made no sign. That they were silent
is in itself a sufficient tribute to the truthfulness of the
book.</p>

<p>I have already said something as to the versions of the
Life:<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> it remains to add that though the MSS. of the
<cite>Compendium</cite> are rare, those of the <cite>Vita</cite> are very numerous,<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>
while the first printed edition of the work was published in
Venice in 1477 by Vindelin da Spira before the edition of
the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> with the comment of Jacopo della
Lana, erroneously attributed to Benvenuto da Imola.
Prof. Macri Leone describes nineteen later editions,
making with his own some twenty-one in all.<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising that the author of this eager defence
of Dante, of the first life of the poet, should on the
petition of the Florentines for a lecturer in the <cite>Divine
Comedy</cite> have been chosen by the Signoria to fill that
honourable and difficult post. His first lecture, as we
have seen, was delivered in the church of Santo
Stefano on Sunday, October 23, 1373. Already an old
man, infirm in health, he can scarcely have hoped to
finish his work, and as it proved he was not able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>complete a sixth part of it, for attacked by illness in the
winter of 1373, he broke off abruptly at the seventeenth
verse of the seventeenth canto of the <cite>Inferno</cite> and returned
to Certaldo really to die. That, after that sudden breakdown,
if such it was, he never resumed his lectures seems
certain, and although it was at the time supposed that Boccaccio
had written a complete commentary on the <cite>Divine
Comedy</cite>, and a fourteenth-century <cite>Comento</cite>, now commonly
known as <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Falso Boccaccio</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> was accepted even by the
Academicians of the Crusca as his work,<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> it seems certain
that the fragment we know as his <cite>Comento</cite> was all that
was ever written, though how much of it was actually
delivered in lectures it is impossible to say.<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>That the <cite>Comento</cite> we have and no other is really the
work of Boccaccio was proved long ago by Manni,<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> for it
seems, that when Boccaccio died at last, a dispute arose
among his heirs as to the meaning of his Will, the bone of
contention being this very <cite>Comento</cite>, which both Fra Martino
da Signa of Santo Spirito in Florence, to whom he had
left his books, claimed as part of his library, and also
Jacopo his half-brother, to whose children Boccaccio had
left all the other property he had.<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> The affair was at last
referred to the Consoli dell' Arte del Cambio, the two sides
submitting their claims in writing. We find there that
Fra Martino, if the <cite>Comento</cite> were adjudged his property,
professed his willingness to let Jacopo have it, a sheet at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>a time, to copy. Jacopo, however, makes no such offer; we
should nevertheless be grateful to him&mdash;he was the victor&mdash;for
in his claim he minutely describes the MS. in question
and so enables us to identify it with those we possess.<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dinanzi a voi domando</span>," we read there, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ventiquattro
quaderni, et quattordici quadernucci, tutti in carta di
bambágia, non legati insieme, ma l' uno dall' altro diviso,
d' uno iscritto, o <em>vero isposizione sopra sedici Capitoli, e parte
del diciassettesimo del Dante, il quale scritto il detto Messer
Giovanni di Boccaccio non compiè</em></span>...."</p>

<p>This incomplete work,<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> which breaks off so suddenly
really in the middle of a paragraph, might seem to be
rather a true commentary, a sort of full notes on the work
in question, such as is still common in Italy, than a series
of lectures delivered <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vivâ voce</i>. Indeed the living voice is
almost entirely absent, and as Dr. Toynbee says, "if it
were not for a single passage at the beginning of his opening
lecture in which he directly addresses his audience as 'Voi,
Signori fiorentini,' it would be difficult to gather from
the work itself that it was composed originally for public
delivery."<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> He seems to have composed it as he would
have composed a book, with the utmost care and foresight,
often referring some point forward to be discussed later;
and thus we may see that he had already considered as a
critic and as a commentator the whole of the work, and
had made up his mind that such and such a reference
would be better discussed at some point in the <cite>Purgatorio</cite>
or at another in the <cite>Paradiso</cite>, and so refused to discuss it
at the moment. His work too is not only filled with
Dantesque thought and phraseology, but is in its form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>composed in the manner of Dante, that is to say, he expounds
first the literal meaning, the obvious sense, and then
the secondary meaning or sense allegorical, just as Dante
does in the <cite>Convivio</cite> when speaking of his <i>Canzoni</i>, and as
he had already begun to do even in the <cite>Vita Nuova</cite>. Nor
was this anything new for Boccaccio; all his life he had
himself written in allegory, and had been used to condemn
those who found no secondary meaning in the poets.<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p>But the most characteristic part of the <cite>Comento</cite>, its
greatest surprise for us too, is perhaps to be found in its
opening. For after excusing himself with his usual
modesty as wholly insufficient for the task, he addresses
his audience as "men of lofty understanding and of wonderful
quickness of understanding"&mdash;facts his commentary
does not altogether lead us to endorse, for he feels called
upon to explain the simplest things,<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> and then after
quoting Plato<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> in the <cite>Timæus</cite> as to the propriety of
invoking divine aid, he asks for God's help not in any
Christian prayer, but in the words of Anchises in the
second <cite>Æneid</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verseq">"Jupiter omnipotens, precibus si flecteris ullis,</p>
<p class="verse">Aspice nos: hoc tantum: et, si pietate meremur</p>
<p class="verse">Da deinde auxilium, pater!"<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He was so much a man of the Renaissance that he does
not seem to have felt it at all inappropriate to ask thus
for God's aid in expounding the greatest of Christian
poems, by addressing himself to Jupiter: he merely explains
that as the work he is to explain is in verse it is
proper to invoke God in verse also.</p>

<p>Having thus asked for God's blessing, he proceeds to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>open his lecture. He first examines the work he is to
discuss as to its kind, then as to its causes, its title and
school of philosophy. In doing so he shows us that he
was aware of the doubtful letter of Dante to Can Grande
della Scala,<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> for he quotes it, though he names it not. He
does not approve of the title&mdash;<cite>The Comedy</cite>&mdash;for such is
used for low subjects and common people; but Dante's
poem is concerned with the greatest persons and deeds,
with sin and penitence, the ways of angels and the secrets
of God. The style too of comedy, he asserts, is humble
and simple, while Dante's poem is lofty and ornate,
although it is written in the vulgar tongue, and he is
obliged to admit that in the Latin it would have had a
finer dignity.</p>

<p>From this he proceeds to discuss Dante's name and its
significance much as he had already done in the <cite>Vita</cite>, and
having decided that the poem belongs to moral philosophy,
proceeds, after formally submitting all he may say
to the judgment of the Catholic Church, to deal with the
<cite>Inferno</cite>. Yet even now he cannot come at the poem
without discussing the <cite>Inferno</cite> itself, whether there be a
Hell, or maybe more than one, where it is placed, how it is
approached, what are its shape and size and its purpose, and
lastly why it is called <cite>Infernus</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Then on the very brink
of the poem he turns away again to discuss why Dante
wrote in Tuscan instead of in Latin; and having given
practically the same explanation as that we have already
noted in the <cite>Vita</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> he proceeds at long last to the <cite>Commentary</cite>
proper.</p>

<p>And here we cannot but be astonished at the extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>mixture of simplicity and subtlety, of elementary
knowledge and profound learning which are heaped
together without any discrimination. There is something
here of the endless leisure of the Middle Age in which
Boccaccio seems determined to say everything. "One
wonders," says Dr. Toynbee, "for what sort of audience
Boccaccio's lectures were intended." In the terms of the
petition the lecturer was to expound the <cite>Commedia</cite> for the
benefit of "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">etiam non grammatici</i>." But it is difficult to
conceive that any audience of Florentines, even of Florentine
children, however ignorant of Latin, let alone the
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">uomini d' alto intendemento e di mirabile perspicacità</span>"
to whom Boccaccio refers in such flattering terms in his
opening lecture, could require to be informed, as
Boccaccio carefully informs it, that an anchor is "an
instrument of iron which has at one end several grapples,
and at the other a ring by which it is attached to a rope
whereby it is let down to the bottom of the sea,"<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> or that
"every ship has three principal parts, of which one is called
the bows, which is sharp and narrow, because it is in front
and has to cut the water; the second is called the poop
and is behind, where the steersman stands to work the
tiller, by means of which, according as it is moved to
one side or the other, the ship is made to go where the
steersman wishes; while the third part is called the keel,
which is the bottom of the ship, and lies between the
bows and the stern,"<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> and so on.</p>

<p>Nor is this all, for even the Bible stories are retold at
length,<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> and a whole discourse is given upon Æneas.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
The elementary subjects dealt with at such length cheek
by jowl with the most profound questions seems to us
extraordinary, nor apparently are we the only readers to
be surprised; for possibly on this account Boccaccio was
bitterly reproached in his own day for lecturing on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span><cite>Commedia</cite> to the vulgar. He replied, really admitting the
offence, and pleading poverty as his excuse in two
sonnets,<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> one of which I quote here:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"If Dante mourns, there wheresoe'er he be</p>

</div>

<p>So much for the vulgar. But, as I have already said,
beside these elementary discourses we find a vast mass
of learning and research that bears eloquent testimony
not only to the extent of Boccaccio's reading, but also
to his eager and careful study of the works of Dante.</p>

<p>Dr. Toynbee has suggested that it was probably owing
to his failing health and energy that he introduced into
the <cite>Comento</cite> so many and so copious extracts from his
own previous works, the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Claris Mulieribus</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> the <cite>De
Casibus Virorum Illustrium</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> the <cite>De Montibus</cite>, <cite>Sylvis</cite>,
<cite>Lacubus</cite>, etc.,<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> and the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Genealogiis Deorum</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> but I think
probably Boccaccio never gave the matter a thought.
His business was to expound, and he used his own
previous works as works of reference&mdash;the best works
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>of the sort, we must remember, that were to be had in
his day. To have named these works&mdash;he never does
refer to them&mdash;would have been useless in those days
before the invention of the printing press; and then they
were themselves mere collections for the most part, the
vast notebooks of his enormous reading.</p>

<p>It is not, however, by any means on them alone he relies,
for he uses and lays under contribution, as it might seem
almost every writer with whose works he was acquainted.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
Of these, two are especially notable, namely, Homer and
Tacitus. He quotes the former six times in all, four
times in the <cite>Iliad</cite><a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> and twice in the <cite>Odyssey</cite>;<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> the last
quotation from the <cite>Iliad</cite> being verbatim from the Latin
translation of Pilatus which Petrarch had copied, the
MS., as we have already noted, being now preserved
in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> As for Tacitus&mdash;and
Boccaccio is the first modern writer to show any
acquaintance with his work&mdash;he uses the fifteenth book
of the <cite>Annals</cite><a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> for his account of the death of Lucan, and
names his source of information,<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> and books twelve to
fifteen for his account of the death of Seneca.<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> The
<cite>Comento</cite> is thus not only a most precious source of
information with regard to the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, but a
kind of <cite>Encyclopædia Dantesca</cite> into which the whole
learning of the age, the whole reading of Boccaccio had
been emptied.</p>

<p>We may perhaps gather something of its significance,
its importance, and its extraordinary reputation if we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>consider for a moment the freedom with which it was
exploited by the commentators who came after.<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Beginning
with the Anonimo Fiorentino, who wrote some thirty
years after Boccaccio's death, perhaps the worst offender,
for he never once mentions Boccaccio's name, while he
copies from him page after page, there follow Benvenuto
da Imola (1373), Francesco da Buti (1385), who make a
very considerable use of his work, the latter especially,
while Landino (1481), the best of the Renaissance commentators,
freely quotes him,<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> calling him "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">huomo, et per
dottrina, et per costumi, et per essere propinquo a' tempi
di Dante, degno di fede</span>." In the sixteenth century Gelli,
who lectured before the Academy of Florence between
1541 and 1561, quotes Boccaccio sixty times, "oftener,"
says Dr. Toynbee, "than he quotes any other commentator
save Landino." He more than once declares that
Boccaccio has explained a passage so well that he can
only repeat his words: "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non saprei io per me trovarci
miglior esposizione che quella del Boccaccio</span>." He at
least and indeed for the first time appreciates the <cite>Comento</cite>
truly.</p>

<p>Considering then this long chorus of praise, though it
be more often the silent praise of imitation than the frank
commendation of acknowledgment, it is strange that only
four MSS. of the <cite>Comento</cite> have come down to us, three in
the Magliabecchiana and one in the Riccardiana libraries
in Florence;<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> while of these only three are complete.<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>
Nor is it less surprising that the first printed edition of
such a work should not have appeared till 1724.<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> This
edition and that by Moutier,<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> which followed it nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>a hundred years later, founded on the same single MS.,
are of little critical value, and that of Fratticelli, published
in 1844, is but a reprint of the Moutier text. It
remained for Gaetano Milanesi, that man of herculean
labour and vast learning, to produce the first critical text
in 1863, three more MSS. of the <cite>Comento</cite> having been discovered
in the meantime. He divided the book into
<i>lezioni</i>, which are but doubtfully of any authority; but
his text holds the field, and he was not slow or cold in
his recognition of the value of the work of one who, almost
a contemporary of Dante, had loved and honoured him,
not only in writing his life and composing a commentary
on his work, but in verse too, as in this inscription for
his portrait:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>
<p class="pfs90">1373-1375</p>
<p class="pfs90 w-sp">ILLNESS AND DEATH</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">That</span> illness which brought those lectures on
the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> so swiftly to an end in
the winter of 1373 was no new thing; for long,
as we have seen, Boccaccio had had a troubled
spirit. If he had recovered from his grief at the death of
Fiammetta, he had never wholly been himself since his
conversion. The disease which then declared itself was
no new thing. In his versatile and athletic spirit there
had always been a strain of melancholy that had shown
itself even in his earliest childhood, when he imagined he
was persecuted; on his arrival in Naples as a boy, when
only a kiss could restore his confidence; in the long years
of his troubled and unstable love and in the loneliness
of his manhood; with old age at his elbow it needed but
little for his spirit, so easily joyful, to be lost in a strange
darkness.</p>

<p>Already before he had been appointed to that lectureship
in Florence he had felt himself seriously ill. Writing
at the end of August, 1373, to Messer Maghinardo de'
Cavalcanti he had excused himself for his long delay in
answering his letter, pleading the "long infirmity which
prevented me from writing to you ... and which only in
the last few days has given me a little respite. Since the
last time I saw you ... every hour of my life has been
very like death, afflicted, tedious, and full of weariness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to myself.... First of all I was beset by a continuous
and burning itching, and a dry scab, to scratch the dry
scales and the flakes of which I had scarce nails enough
day or night; then I was afflicted by a heaviness, a
sluggishness of the bowels, a perpetual agony of the veins,
swelling of the spleen, a burning bile, a suffocating cough
and hoarseness, heaviness of head, and indeed more
maladies than I know how to enumerate; all my body
languished, and all its humours were at war. And so
it happened that I looked on the sky without happiness;
my body was weary, my steps vacillating, my hand
trembled; I was deathly pale, cared nothing for food, but
held it all in abhorrence. Letters were odious to me,
my books, once so delightful to me, could not please me,
the forces of the soul were relaxed, my memory almost
gone, my energy seemed drugged, and my thoughts were
all turned to the grave and to death."<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

<p>But this was not all. He had scarcely got so far in
his letter, he writes, when on August 12 a new ill befell
him. At sunset a burning fever attacked him so fiercely
that he could not leave his bed. As the night advanced
the fever increased, his head ached violently, and without
respite he turned and turned again in his bed, wearily
looking thus for some relief. He was alone with only an
old servant, who could do nothing but weep. Day came
and with it some friends, who would have sent for a
physician; but Boccaccio, with less gentleness than
Petrarch showed, refused, till at last, utterly worn out, he
allowed himself to be persuaded. The doctor who came
to him was "a country doctor, accustomed to attend the
peasants," as he says, "but kind and thoughtful." He told
Boccaccio that unless he could rid himself of the poison
which was killing him he would be dead in a few days.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>He brought in a cautery, a furnace, and other terrible
instruments used then in medical practice. He then proceeded
to use them, burning the patient largely, in many
places cutting him with a razor and slashing his skin.
He suffered dreadfully, but the doctor told him he was
healed. And, it might seem by a direct miracle of God,
he was saved out of the hands of this criminal lunatic;
he slept, and little by little recovered. He was, however,
very feeble. Nothing he can say against doctors can
seem absurd, or exaggerated, or less than just when we
remember that he had the unhappiness to fall at last into
their hands.<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<p>It is possible that his friends in Florence heard of his
miseries and his poverty&mdash;for he was very poor, and it was
really on his behalf the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cathedra Dantesca</i> was founded.
However that may be, it might have seemed impossible
that one in his case could have accepted it, yet in spite of
his weakness he left Certaldo and went to Florence, where,
as we have seen, in accordance with the decree of the
Signoria he began to lecture in October. That he broke
down is not surprising; it is only wonderful that he got as
far as he did. But that brief burst of energy was his last;
in the winter of 1373 he returned to Certaldo really
to die.</p>

<p>From that moment all his melancholy seems to have
returned to him with fourfold strength: he who had taken
his fill of life, now could no more look happily on the sky,
he was a dying man and he knew it. He groped about
far from Petrarch looking for some appalling certainty.
He seems to have thought he could find it in the monastic
life, and his solitude must have been not less profound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Death and thoughts about death haunted him, as they
are wont to do imaginative people. It must have been in
some such darkness as that which then fell upon him
that he wrote more than one of the sonnets in which he
seems to have sought in verse the power to realise what it
was that was about to befall him.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1374 a new blow fell upon him. Petrarch
was dead.<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> He heard the news first as a rumour,
and then, some three months after his friend had passed
away, in a letter from Francesco da Brossano, the poet's
son-in-law, whom he had met at Venice. That he had
already heard of his loss when he got Franceschino's letter
we gather from his reply, written in the beginning of
November:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I received your sorrowful letter, most well beloved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>brother, on the 31st October,"<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> he writes, "and not knowing
the writing I broke the seal and looked for the name of
the writer, and as soon as I read your name I knew what
news you had to tell me, that is to say, the happy passing
of our illustrious father and master, Francesco Petrarch,
from the earthly Babylon to the heavenly Jerusalem.
Although none of my friends had written me save you,
since every one spoke of it I had known it for some time&mdash;to
my great sorrow&mdash;and during many days I wept almost
without ceasing&mdash;not at his ascension, but for myself thus
unhappy and abandoned. And that is not wonderful, for
no one in the world loved him more than I. And so to
acquit myself, my intention was to go at once to mix my
tears with yours, to lament with you and to say a last
farewell at the tomb of this illustrious father. But more
than ten months ago now<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> a malady, rather long and
wearying than dangerous, surprised me in my native city
[patria], where I was publicly expounding the <cite>Comedy</cite> of
Dante. And because for four months, at the request of
my friends, I followed the advice, I will not say of the
doctors, but of charlatans [fabulonum], my malady did
nothing but increase. The potions and the diet so upset
all nutrition that unless you saw me you would not believe
how weak I am become, and my appearance only too well
confirms it. Wretched man that I am, you would no
longer recognise him whom you saw in Venice. My skin,
lately well filled, is empty now, my colour is changed, my
sight dulled, while my knees shake and my hands tremble.
It follows that, far from crossing the proud summits of the
Apennine, on the advice of some of my friends I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>just been able to return from my native city into the
country of my ancestors at Certaldo. It is there I am
now, half dead and restless, utterly idle and uncertain of
myself, waiting only on God, who is able to heal me. But
enough about myself.</p>

<p>"The sight and the reading of your letter having renewed
my sorrow, I wept anew almost all night long. It
is not Petrarch for whom I weep, for in recalling his
integrity, his way of life, his youth, his old age, his
prayers, his innate piety, his love of God and of his neighbour,
I am assured that, delivered from the anguish of this
miserable life, he has flown away to the heavenly Father,
where he joys in Christ and the glory everlasting; it is for
myself I weep and for his friends left in this tempestuous
world like ships without rudders, driven by the winds and
the waves into the midst of rocks. And in considering
thus the innumerable agitations of my soul, I can easily
divine what are your feelings and those of Tullia, my dear
sister and your wife, whom I will always honour. I am
sure you must feel a still keener bitterness than I ... but
this you know too if you are wise, as I believe you to be,
that we are all born to die. Our Silvanus has done what
we shall do too in a little while. He is dead who was full
of years. What do I say? He is not dead, but he has
gone before us. Seated among the just, he pities our
miseries, praying the Father of Mercy that He will give us
strength to combat our faults during our pilgrimage, that
when death comes He will give us a perfect end pleasing
to Him; and that notwithstanding the snares of our
adversary, He will lead us to Himself. I will say no
more, for, as you will think I am sure, those who love this
great man ought not only to cease from weeping, but to
think only of the joy and hope of their coming salvation.
I pray you then, in the name of your fidelity and of our
friendship, offer this consolation to Tullia. For women
are less able to support such shocks as this than we, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>have therefore need of the firmer stay of men. But you
have without doubt already done so.</p>

<div class="caption">BOCCACCIO'S HOUSE IN CERTALDO</div>
</div>

<p>"You say that he has ended his days at the village of
Arquà in the <i>contado</i> of Padua; that he wished his
ashes to remain always in that village, and that, to commemorate
him for ever, a rich and splendid tomb is there
to be built. Alas, I admit my crime, if it can be called
a crime. I who am a Florentine grudge Arquà this shining
good fortune that has befallen her rather through his
humility than through her merit: the guardianship of the
body of the man whose soul has been the favourite dwelling-place
of the Muses and of all Helicon, the sanctuary of
philosophy, the splendid ornament of the liberal arts,&mdash;of
the man who above all others was possessed of Ciceronian
eloquence as his writings show, has been confided to her.
It follows that not only Arquà, almost unknown even to
the Paduans, will now be known by all foreign nations
however far off, but that her name will be held in honour
by the whole universe. One will honour thee, Arquà, as,
without seeing them, we honour in our thoughts the hill
of Posilipo, at the foot of which are placed the bones of
Virgil; ... and Smyrna, where Homer sleeps, and other
like places.... I do not doubt that the sailor returning
laden with riches from the farthest shores of the sea, sailing
the Adriatic and seeing afar the venerable summits of
the Euganean Hills, will say to himself or to his friends:
'Those hills guard in their breast the glory of the universe,
him who was once the triumph of all knowledge,
Petrarch the poet of sweet words, who by the Consular
Senate was crowned in the Mother City with the laurel of
triumph, and whose many beautiful works still proclaim
his inviolable renown.' The black Indian, the fierce
Spaniard ... seized with admiration for this sacred name,
will one day come and before the tomb of so great a man
salute with respect and piety the ashes which it holds,
complaining the while of their misfortune that they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
not have seen him living whom dead they visit. Alas, my
unhappy city, to whom it has not been given to guard the
ashes of so illustrious a son, to whom so splendid a glory
has been refused, it is true that thou art unworthy of such
an honour, thou hast neglected to draw him to thee when
he was alive and to give him that place in thy heart
which he merited. Ah, had he been an artisan of crimes,
a contriver of treasons, a past master in avarice, envy, and
ingratitude, thou wouldst have called him to thee. Yet
even as thou art I should prefer that this honour had been
accorded thee rather than Arquà. But it is thus is justified
the old saying, 'A prophet is not without honour save
in his own country.' For he always knew how to avoid it,
that he might imitate Christ his Master and Redeemer in
humility, Who preferred to be born according to the flesh
at Nazareth rather than at Jerusalem, and Who loved
better to have for mother a poor virgin who was holy than
the most proud and powerful queens of His time. And so,
since God has wished it, let the name of Arquà live
through the centuries and let her inhabitants preserve
always an honour for which they should indeed be
thankful.</p>

<p>"But I am glad that a tomb is to be erected, for the
splendour of his name and the magnificence of his works
render him worthy of it. It is very probable, however,
that it will seem of little importance to the eyes of the
learned, who consider rather the qualities of the dead
than the honours done to their bodies, to whom he has
manifested himself in many volumes, outshining the sun.
But that tomb will be a means of impressing the ignorant,
whose books are sculptures and paintings....</p>

<p>"As for his generosity towards his friends and to
myself, I cannot briefly tell it over, and so I leave it for
another time, should it offer, contenting myself for the
moment with these words. I have known by his many
benefits towards me in time past how much he loved me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
while he lived. I see now by his actions<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> that his friendship
has followed me even in his death, and unless in a better
life after this passage that we call death one loses one's
friends, I think he will love me still. He will love me not
because I have merited it, but because he is always faithful
to him whom he has once adopted for his own, and I have
been his during forty years and more.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> And now, when
he can no longer show his affection by words or by
writings, he has wished to number me among his heirs,
so you write me, leaving me a very ample portion of his
wealth. How happy I am, and how I rejoice that he has
acted as he has done, but I regret to be forced to come so
soon into possession of his legacy that I shall accept with
joy. I should like better to see him live and to be deprived
of his gift; but this is a pious wish, and in thanking
you for your affection I accept as the supreme gift and
legacy of his kindness what you sent me some days ago.</p>

<p>"This letter should have finished there, but friendship
constrains me to add something more. I should have
learned with pleasure what has been done with the library&mdash;so
very precious as it is&mdash;of this illustrious man, for with
us opinion is divided. But what worries me most is to
know what is become of the works he composed, and
especially his <cite>Africa</cite>, which I consider as an inspired
work. Does it still exist, and will it be preserved, or has
it been burned, as when he was alive you know well this
severe critic of his own work threatened? I learn that
the examination of this work and of others has been
confided, by I know not whom, to certain persons. I am
astonished at the ignorance of him who has had the
management of this affair, but still more do I wonder at
the temerity and lightness of those who have undertaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>the examination. Who would dare to criticise what our
illustrious master has approved? Not Cicero himself, if
he returned, nor Horace, nor Virgil, would dare to do so.
Alas, I fear that this examination has been confided to
the jurists, who because they know law, just those by
which they impudently live, imagine they know everything.
I pray God that He take notice of it, and that He
protect the poems and other sacred inventions of our
master. Let me hear if the cause is yet submitted to
these judges, and if those who desire can approach these
men. Tell me too what is become of the other works, and
especially of the book of the <cite>Trionfi</cite>, which, according to
some, has been burnt on the advice of the judges ...
than whom learning has no more ignorant enemies.
Besides, I know how many envies still attack the reputation
of this most eminent man. Certainly, if they can,
they will spoil his works, they will hide them, they will
condemn them; they do not understand, and they will
make every effort that they may be lost to us. Prevent this
with all your vigilance, for the best men now and in the
future of Italy will be deprived of a great advantage if all
these works remain at the mercy of the ignorant and
the envious....</p>

<p>"I have finished this letter at Certaldo, the 7th November,<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>
and as you see, I cannot say I have written in haste,
I have taken almost three whole days to write this short
epistle, with a few intervals to allow me to rest my exhausted
body.</p>

<p class="right">"Your Giovanni Boccaccio, if he still exists."<br /></p>

<p>That letter was in truth his swan song. In the previous
August he had made his Will,<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> and lonely in the
dark house in Certaldo,<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> he had little else to do than to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>pray "the Father of Mercy to lead him to Himself." In
those last months, at any rate, he seems to have given
himself up almost with passion to religious contemplation.
He who had been so scornful of relics filled his house with
them, eagerly collecting them whenever he could in spite
of his poverty.<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> He seems too to have consoled himself,
as many another has done, with the perfect beauty of the
Divine Office, for a Breviary was among his books, and is
named in his Will. That is almost all we know or may
conjecture concerning those last days, which he passed,
it seems, almost in solitude<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> on that hill of Certaldo&mdash;a
magician, as was said of Virgil and Ovid by the folk of
Naples and Sulmona, knowing all the secrets of Nature.</p>

a hard saying? But by what other title shall we greet
the author of the <cite>Decameron</cite>, who is as secure in his immortality
and as great in his narrative power as the author
of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, and infinitely greater in his humanism
and influence?</p>

<p>The greatest work of the fourteenth century, as the
<cite>Divine Comedy</cite> had been of the thirteenth, the <cite>Decameron</cite>
sums up and reflects its period altogether impersonally,
while the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> would scarcely hold us at all
without the impassioned personality of Dante to inform it
everywhere with his profound life, his hatred, his love, his
judgment of this world and the next. It is strange that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the work which best represents the genius of Boccaccio,
his humour and wide tolerance and love of mankind, should
in this be so opposite to all his other works in the vulgar
tongue, which are inextricably involved with his own personal
affairs, his view of things, his love, his contempt, his
hatred. Yet you will scarcely find him in all the hundred
tales of the <cite>Decameron</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> He speaks to us there once or
twice, as we shall see, but always outside the stories, and
his whole treatment of the various and infinite plots, incidents,
and characters of his great work is as impersonal
as life itself.</p>

<p>The <cite>Decameron</cite> is an absolute work of art, as "detached"
as a play by Shakespeare or a portrait by Velasquez.
The scheme is formal and immutable, a miracle of design
in which almost everything can be expressed. To compare
it with the plan of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> is to demonstrate
its superiority. There you have a sleepless king, to
whom a woman tells a thousand and one stories in order
to save her life which this same king would have taken.
You have, then, but two protagonists and an anxiety
which touches but one of them, the fear of death on the
part of the woman, soon forgotten in the excitement of
the stories. In the <cite>Decameron</cite>, on the other hand, you
have ten protagonists, three youths and seven ladies, and
the horror which is designed to set off the stories is an
universal pestilence which has already half depopulated
the city of Florence, from which they are fled away.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise en scène</i> is so well known as scarcely to need
describing, for the Prologue in which it is set forth is one
of the most splendid pieces of descriptive narrative in all
literature, impressionist too in our later manner, and absolutely
convincing. Boccaccio evokes for us the city of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>Florence in the grip of the Black Death of 1348. We see
the streets quite deserted or horrible with the dead, and
over all a dreadful silence broken only by the more dreadful
laughter of those whom the plague has freed from all
human constraint. Fear has seized upon such of the
living as death has not driven mad, "wherefore the sick of
both sexes, whose number could not be estimated, were
left without resource but in the charity of friends (and few
such there were), or the interest of servants, who were
hardly to be had at high rates and on unseemly terms, and
being moreover men and women of gross understanding
and for the most part unused to such offices, concerned
themselves no further than to supply the immediate and
expressed wants of the sick and to watch them die, in
which service they themselves not seldom perished with
their gains. In consequence of which dearth of servants
and dereliction of the sick by neighbours, kinsfolk, and
friends, it came to pass&mdash;a thing perhaps never before
heard of&mdash;that no woman, however dainty, fair, or well
born she might be, shrank, when stricken with the disease,
from the attentions of a man, no matter whether he were
young or no, or scrupled to expose to him every part of
her body with no more shame than if he had been a
woman, submitting of necessity to that which her malady
required; wherefrom, perchance, there resulted in after
time some loss of modesty in such as recovered....
What need we add, but that such and so grievous was the
harshness of heaven, and perhaps in some degree of man,
that, what with the fury of the pestilence, the panic of
those whom it spared and their consequent neglect or
desertion of not a few of the stricken in their need, it is
believed without any manner of doubt, that between
March and the ensuing July upwards of a hundred
thousand human beings lost their lives within the walls of
the city of Florence, which before the deadly visitation
would not have been supposed to contain so many people!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
How many grand palaces, how many stately homes, how
many splendid houses once full of retainers, of lords, of
ladies, were now left desolate of all, even to the meanest
servant!...</p>

<p>"Irksome it is to myself to rehearse in detail so
mournful a history. Wherefore, being minded to pass
over so much thereof as I fairly can, I say that our city
being thus depopulated, it so happened, as I afterwards
learned from one of credit, that on Tuesday morning after
Divine service the venerable church of Santa Maria Novella
was almost deserted save for the presence of seven young
ladies, habited sadly, in keeping with the season.... The
first, being the eldest of the seven, we will call Pampinea,
the second Fiammetta, the third Filomena, the fourth
Emilia, the fifth we will distinguish as Lauretta, the sixth
as Neifile, and the last, not without reason, shall be named
Elisa. 'Twas not of set purpose but by mere chance that
these ladies met in the same part of the church, but at
length, grouping themselves into a sort of circle, ... they
gave up saying paternosters and began to converse (among
other topics) on the times.... Here we tarry (said Pampinea)
as if one thinks for no other purpose than to bear
witness to the number of corpses that are brought hither
for interment.... If we quit the church we see dead
or sick folk carried about, or we see those who for their
crimes were of late exiled, ... but who now in contempt
of the law, well knowing its ministers are sick or dead,
have returned.... Nor hear we aught but: Such and
such are dead.... Such and such are dying.... Or go
we home, what see we there? I know not if you are in
like case with me; but there where once were servants in
plenty I find none left but my maid and shudder with
terror.... And turn or tarry where I may, I encounter
only the ghosts of the departed, not with their wonted
mien but with something horrible in their aspect that
appals me.... So (she continues) I should deem it most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
wise in us, our case being what it is, if, as many others
have done before us and are doing now, we were to quit
the place, and shunning like death the evil example of
others, betake ourselves to the country and there live as
honourable women on one of the estates of which none of
us has any lack, with all cheer of festal gathering and
other delights so long as in no particular we overstep the
bounds of reason. There we shall hear the chant of birds,
have sight of green hills and plains, of cornfields undulating
like the sea, of trees of a thousand sorts; there
also we shall have a larger view of the heavens, which,
however harsh to usward, yet deny not their eternal
beauty; things fairer far for eyes to rest on than the desolate
walls of our city.... For though the husbandmen
die there even as here the citizens, they are dispersed in
scattered homes, and so 'tis less painful to witness. Nor,
so far as I can see, is there a soul here whom we shall desert;
rather we may truly say that we are ourselves
deserted.... No censure then can fall on us if we do as
I propose; and otherwise grievous suffering, perhaps
death, may ensue."</p>

<p>Pampinea's plan was received with eagerness, and while
they were still discussing it there came into the church
three young men, Pamfilo, Filostrato, and Dioneo, the
youngest about twenty-five years of age. These seemed
to the ladies to be sent by Providence, for their only fear
till now had been in carrying out their plans alone. So
Pampinea, who had a kinsman among them, approached
them, and greeting them gaily, opened her plan, and
besought them on behalf of herself and her friends to
join their company. The young men as soon as they
found she was in earnest answered with alacrity that they
were ready, and promptly before leaving the church set
matters in train for their departure, and the next day at
dawn they set out. Arrived at the estate they entered a
beautiful palace in the midst of a garden, and again it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Pampinea who proposed that one among them should be
elected chief for a day so that each might be in turn in
authority. They at once chose Pampinea, whom Filomena
crowned with bay leaves. Later, towards evening, they
"hied them to a meadow ... and at the queen's command
ranged themselves in a circle on the grass and
hearkened while she spoke thus: 'You mark that the sun
is yet high, the heat intense, and the silence unbroken
save by the <i>cicale</i> among the olives. It were therefore
the height of folly to quit this spot at present. Here the
air is cool, and the prospect fair, and here, observe, are
dice and chess. Take then your pleasure as you will;
but if you hear my advice you will find pastime for the
hot hours before us, not in play in which the loser must
needs be vexed, ... but in telling stories in which the
invention of one may afford solace to all the company
of his hearers.'"</p>

<p>This was found pleasing to all, and so Pampinea turned
at last to Pamfilo, who sat at her right hand, and bade him
lead off with one of his stories. So begins the series of
immortal tales which compose the <cite>Decameron</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>Such, then, is the incomparable design which the <cite>Decameron</cite>
fills, beside which the mere haphazard telling of
<cite>The Hundred Merry Tales</cite> seems barbarous, the setting
of <cite>The Thousand and One Nights</cite> inadequate. That
Boccaccio's design has indeed ever been bettered might
well be denied, but in <cite>The Canterbury Tales</cite> Chaucer
certainly equalled it. If the occasion there is not so
dramatic nor the surroundings at once so poignant and
so beautiful, the pilgrimage progresses with the tales and
allows of such a dramatic entry as that of the Canon
and the Canon's yeoman at Boghton-under-Blee. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
entry was most fitting and opportune, right in every way,
and though there is no inherent reason why the <cite>Decameron</cite>
itself should not have been similarly broken in
upon, the very stillness of that garden in the sunshine
would have made any such interruption less acceptable.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

<p>The true weakness of the <cite>Decameron</cite> in comparison
with that of the <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite> is not a weakness
of design but of character. Each of Chaucer's pilgrims
is a complete human being; they all live for us more
vividly than any other folk, real or imagined, of the fourteenth
century in England, and each is different from
the rest, a perfect human character and personality.
But in the protagonists of the <cite>Decameron</cite> it is not so.
There is nothing, or almost nothing, to choose between
them. Pampinea is not different from Filomena,<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> and
may even be confused with Pamfilo or Filostrato. We
know nothing of them; they are without any character
or personality, and indeed the only one of them all who
stands out in any way is Dioneo, and that merely because
he may usually be depended upon for the most licentious
tale of the day.<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> In Chaucer the tales often weary us, but
the tellers never do; in Boccaccio the tales never weary
us, but the tellers always do. Just there we come upon
the fundamental difference between English and what I
may call perhaps Latin art. It is the same to-day as
yesterday. In the work of D' Annunzio, as in the work
of the French novelists of our time, it is always an affair
of situation, that is to say, the narrative or drama rises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>out of the situation, rather than out of the character of
the actors, while even in the most worthless English work
there is, as there has always been, an attempt at least to
realise character, to make it the fundamental thing in the
book, from which the narrative proceeds and by which it
lives and is governed.</p>

<p>In dealing with the <cite>Decameron</cite>, then, we must, more or
less, leave the narrators themselves out of the question;
they are not to be judged; they are but an excuse for the
stories, and are really puppets who can in no way be held
responsible for them, so that if now and then an especially
licentious tale is told by one of those "virtuous" ladies, it
is of no account, for the tales are altogether independent
of those who tell them. But if these young and fair
protagonists soon pass from our remembrance in the infinitely
vivid and living stories they tell, yes, almost like
a phonograph, the setting, the background of a plague-stricken
and deserted city, the beauty and languorous
peace of the delicious gardens in which we listen, always
remain with us, so much so that tradition has identified
the two palaces which are the setting of the whole
<cite>Decameron</cite> with two of those villas which are the glory of
the Florentine <i>contado</i>.</p>

<p>The first of these palaces&mdash;that to which they came on
that Wednesday morning&mdash;was, Boccaccio tells us, not
more than "two short miles from the city" There "on
the brow of the hill was a palace, with a fine and spacious
courtyard in the midst, and with loggias and halls and
rooms, all and each one in itself beautiful and ornamented
tastefully with jocund paintings. It was surrounded too
with grass plots and marvellous gardens, and with wells of
coldest water, and there were cellars of rare wines, a thing
perhaps more suited to curious topers than to quiet and
virtuous ladies. And the palace was clean and in good
order, the beds prepared and made, and everything
decorated with spring flowers, and the floors covered with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>rushes, all much to their satisfaction." This "estate" has
always been identified with Poggio Gherardo,<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> which now
stands above the road to Settignano, about a mile from
that village and some two miles from the Porta alle Croce
of Florence. In the fourteenth century certainly it must
have been equi-distant on all sides from the roads, the
nearest being the Via Aretina Nuova by the Arno and the
road to Fiesole or the Via Faentina, for the way from
Florence to Settignano was a mule-track.</p>

<div class="caption">POGGIO GHERARDO, NEAR SETTIGNANO, FLORENCE<br />

<i>(The scene of the first two days of the "Decameron.")</i></div>
</div>

<p>Poggio Gherardo is but a stone's throw from Corbignano,
the country house&mdash;half farm, half villa&mdash;which Margherita
brought to Boccaccino as part of her dowry, and where, as
we have seen, it appears likely that Boccaccio spent his
first youth. But Poggio Gherardo is not the only palace
of the <cite>Decameron</cite>. At the close of the second day
Madonna Filomena took the laurel crown from her head
and crowned Neifile queen, and it was she who then proposed
that they should change their residence.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, as you know," said she, "is Friday, and
the next day is Saturday, and both are days which are
apt to be tedious to most of us on account of the kind of
food we take on them; and then Friday was the day on
which He who died that we might live suffered His
Passion, and it is therefore worthy of reverence, and ought,
as I think, to be spent rather in prayer than in telling tales.
And on Saturday it is the custom for women to wash the
powder out of their hair, and make themselves generally
sweet and neat; also they use to fast out of reverence
for the Virgin Mother of God, and in honour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
coming rest from any and every work. Therefore, since
we cannot, on that day either, carry out our established
order of life, I think it would be well to refrain from
reciting tales also. And as by then we shall have been
here already four days, I think we might seek a new place
if we would avoid visitors; and indeed I have already a
spot in my mind."</p>

<p>And it happened as she said, for they all praised her
words and looked forward longingly to Sunday.</p>

<p>On that very day the sun was already high when,
"with slow steps, the queen with her friends and the three
gentlemen, led by the songs of some twenty nightingales,
took her way westward by an unfrequented lane full of
green herbs and flowers just opening after the dawn. So,
gossiping and playing and laughing with her company,
she led them ... to a beautiful and splendid palace
before half of the third hour was gone." It is by this
"unfrequented lane" that we too may pass to the Villa
Palmieri,<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> which tradition assures us is the very place.
"When they had entered and inspected everything, and
seen that the halls and rooms had been cleaned and
decorated and plentifully supplied with all that was needed
for sweet living, they praised its beauty and good order,
and admired the owner's magnificence. And on descending,
even more delighted were they with the pleasant and
spacious courts, the cellars filled with choice wines, and
the beautifully fresh water which was everywhere round
about. Then they went into the garden, which was on
one side of the palace, and was surrounded by a wall, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the beauty and magnificence of it at first sight made them
eager to examine it more closely. It was crossed in all
directions by long, broad, and straight walks, over which
the vines, which that year made a great show of giving
many grapes, hung gracefully in arched festoons, and being
then in full blossom, filled the whole garden with their
sweet smell, and this, mingled with the odours of the
other flowers, made so sweet a perfume that they seemed
to be in the spicy gardens of the East. The sides of the
walks were almost closed with red and white roses and
with jessamine, so that they gave sweet odours and shade
not only in the morning, but when the sun was high, and
one might walk there all day without fear. What flowers
there were there, how various and how ordered, it would
take too long to tell, but there was not one which in our
climate is to be praised that was not found there abundantly.
Perhaps the most delightful thing therein was a
meadow in the midst, of the finest grass, and all so
green that it seemed almost black, all sprinkled with a
thousand various flowers, shut in by oranges and cedars,
the which bore the ripe fruit and the young fruit too
and the blossom, offering a shade most grateful to the
eyes and also a delicious perfume. In the midst of this
meadow there was a fountain of the whitest marble,
marvellously carved and within&mdash;I do not know whether
artificially or from a natural spring&mdash;threw so much water
and so high towards the sky through a statue which stood
there on a pedestal that it would not have needed more
to turn a mill. The water fell back again with a delicious
sound into the clear waters of the basin, and the surplus
was carried off through a subterranean way into little
water channels, most beautifully and artfully made about
the meadow, and afterwards it ran into others round
about, and so watered every part of the garden, and
collected at length in one place, whence it had entered
the beautiful garden, it turned two mills, much to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
profit, as you may suppose, of the <i>signore</i>, pouring down
at last in a stream clear and sweet into the valley."</p>

<p>If this should seem a mere pleasaunce of delight, the
vision of a poet, the garden of a dream, we have only to
remember how realistically and simply Boccaccio has
described for us that plague-stricken city, scarcely more
than a mile away, to be assured of its truthfulness. And
then, Villa Palmieri is nearly as beautiful to-day as it was
so long ago; only while the gardens with their pergolas of
vines, their hedges of jasmine and crimson roses, their
carved marble fountains remain, the two mills he speaks of
are gone, having been destroyed in a flood of the Mugnone
in 1409, less than sixty years after he wrote of them.</p>

<div class="caption">VILLA PALMIERI, NEAR FLORENCE<br />

<i>(The scene of the third and following days of the "Decameron.")</i></div>
</div>

<p>Nor are the two palaces the only places mentioned in
the <cite>Decameron</cite>, set as it is in the country about Florence,
that we may identify. It was a summer afternoon, six
days had almost passed, Dioneo had just been crowned king
by Madonna Elisa: the tales had been short that day,
and the sun was yet high, so that Madonna, seeing the
gentlemen were set down to play at dice (and "such is the
custom of men"), called her friends to her and said: "'Ever
since we have been here I have wished to show you a place
not far off where, I believe, none of you has ever been;
it is called La Valle delle Donne, and till to-day I have
not had a chance to speak of it. It is yet early; if you
choose to come with me, I promise you that you will
be pleased with your walk.' And they answered they
were all willing: so without saying a word to the gentlemen,
they called one of their women to attend them, and
after a walk of nearly a mile they came to the place which
they entered by a strait path where there burst forth a fair
crystal stream, and they found it so beautiful and so
pleasant, especially in those hot still hours of afternoon,
that nothing could excel it; and as some of them told me
later, the little plain in the valley was an exact circle, as
though it had been described by a pair of compasses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>yet it was indeed rather the work of Nature than of
man. It was about half a mile in circumference, surrounded
by six hills of moderate height, on each of which
was a palace built in the form of a little castle.... And
then what gave them the greatest delight was the rivulet
that came through a valley which divided two hills, and
running through the rocks fell suddenly and sweetly
in a waterfall seeming, as it was dashed and sprinkled
in drops all about, like so much quicksilver. Coming into
the little plain beneath this fall, the stream was received in
a fine canal, and running swiftly to the midst of the plain
formed itself in a pool not deeper than a man's breast
and so clear that you might see the gravelly bottom and
the pebbles intermixed, which indeed you might count;
and there were fishes there also swimming up and down
in great plenty; and the water that overflowed was received
into another little canal which carried it out of the
valley. There the ladies all came together, and ... finding
it commendable ... did, as 'twas very hot and they
deemed themselves secure from observation, resolve to take
a bath. So having bidden their maid wait and keep watch
over the access to the vale, and give them warning if haply
any should approach it, they all seven undressed and got
into the water, which to the whiteness of their flesh was
even such a veil as fine glass is to the vermeil of the rose.<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
They being then in the water, the clearness of which was
thereby in no wise affected, did presently begin to go hither
and thither after the fish, which had much ado where to
bestow themselves so as to escape out of their hands....
'Twas quite early when they returned to the palace, so that
they found the gallants still at play."</p>

<p>This delicious spot, called to this day the Valle delle
Donne,<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> may be reached from the "unfrequented lane"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>by which they all passed from Poggio Gherardo to Villa
Palmieri; as Landor, who lived close by, tells us:&mdash;</p>

<p>The hundred tales that were thus told in the shade of
those two beautiful gardens may doubtless be traced to an
infinite number of sources&mdash;Egyptian, Arabian, Persian,
and French;<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> but these origins matter little. Boccaccio
was almost certainly unaware of them, for the most part at
any rate, gathering his material as he did from the tales he
had heard, up and down Italy. Certainly to the Contes and
Fabliaux of Northern France a third part of the <cite>Decameron</cite>
may be traced, much too to Indian and Persian sources,
and a little to the <cite>Gesta Romanorum</cite>. But one might as
well accuse Chaucer or Shakespeare of a want of originality
because they took what they wanted where they found it,
as arraign Boccaccio for a dependence he was quite unaware
of on sources such as these.<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> He has made the
tales his own. The <cite>Decameron</cite> is a work of art, a world in
itself, and its effect upon us who read it is the effect of
life which includes, for its own good, things moral and
immoral. The book has the variety of the world, and
is full of an infinity of people, who represent for us the
fourteenth century in Italy, in all its fullness, almost.<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>It deals with man as life does, never taking him very
seriously, or without a certain indifference, a certain irony
and laughter. Yet it is full too of a love of courtesy, of
luck, of all sorts of adventures, both gallant and sad. In
details, at any rate, it is true and even realistic, crammed
with observation of those customs and types which made
up the life of the time. It is dramatic, ironic, comic, tragic,
philosophic, and even lyrical; full of indulgence for human
error, an absolutely human book beyond any work of
Dante's or Petrarch's or Froissart's. Even Chaucer is not
so complete in his humanism, his love of all sorts and
conditions of men. Perfect in organism, in construction,
and in freedom, each of these tales is in some sort a living
part of life and a criticism of it. Almost any one could
be treated by a modern writer in his own way, and remain
fundamentally the same and fundamentally true. What
immorality there is, might seem owing rather to the
French sources of some of the tales than to any invention
on the part of Boccaccio, who, as we have seen, later came
to deplore it. But we must remember that the book was
written to give delight to "amorous" women, and women
have always delighted in "immoral literature," and in fact
write most of it to-day.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> Yet only a Puritan, and he foul-minded,
could call the <cite>Decameron</cite> vicious, for it is purified
with an immortal laughter and joy.</p>

<p>But it is in its extraordinary variety of contents and
character that the <cite>Decameron</cite> is chiefly remarkable. We
are involved in a multitude of adventures, are introduced
to innumerable people of every class, and each class shows
us its most characteristic qualities. Such is Boccaccio's
art, for the stories were not originally, or even as they are,
ostensibly studies of character at all, but rather anecdotes,
tales of adventure, stories of illicit love, good stories about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the friars and the clergy and women, told for amusement
because they are full of laughter and are witty, or contain
a brief and ready reply with which one has rebuked
another or saved himself from danger. But I have given
the subjects of the stories of the <cite>Decameron</cite> elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>
Whatever they may be, and they are often of the best, of
the most universal, they are not, for the real lover of the
<cite>Decameron</cite>, the true reason why he goes to it always with
the certainty of a new joy. The book is full of people, of
living people, that is the secret of its immortality. Fra
Cipolla, whom I especially love, Calandrino, whom I seem
always to have known, poor Monna Tezza, his wife, whom
at last he so outrageously gives away, Griselda, Cisti, the
Florentine baker, the joyous Madonna Filippa, or Monna
Belcolore should be as dear to us as any character in any
book not by Shakespeare himself. They live for ever.</p>

<p>And yet it must be confessed that while the book is a
mirror of the world, and doubtless as true to the life of its
time as any book that was ever written, it lacks a certain
idealism, a certain moral sense which is never absent from
English work, and which, even from a purely æsthetic
point of view, would have given a sort of balance or sense
of proportion to the book, which, I confess, in my weaker
moments, it has sometimes seemed to me it lacks.</p>

<div class="caption">LA VALLE DELLE DONNE<br />

<i>From a print of the XVIII century in Baldelli's "Vita di Gio: Boccaccio."</i></div>
</div>

<p>It is true that Boccaccio deals with life and with life
alone. It is true that life then as now made little of
sexual morality. But with Boccaccio, as with almost all
Latin art, sexual immorality usurps, or seems to us to
usurp, a place out of all proportion to its importance in
life. One is not always thinking of one's neighbour's
wife, even though one should have the misfortune to
affect her. Yet it is just there that Boccaccio's comic
genius is seen at its best; it is his most frequent theme.
And just there too we come upon the unreality of this
most real book. His <i>spose</i> are all beautiful young women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>who live in the arms of beautiful youths; they are nearly
all adulteresses; Griselda, indeed, might seem to be the
only faithful wife among them. Consider, then, the wife
of Pietro di Vincolo,<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> who sells herself fresh and lovely as
she is. Consider the pretty Prunella the Neapolitan, who
abandons herself voluptuously in her husband's presence
to Gianello Galeone.<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> She, like the rest, is not only
without regret, but without scruple. They all have this
extraordinary astuteness, this readiness of the devil.
There is Sismonda, the wife of the rich merchant Arriguccio
Berlinghieri.<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> There is Isabella, who loved Leonetto,
and Monna Beatrice, who to her adultery adds contempt
of her husband, when, victorious at last, trembling with
voluptuousness, she kisses and re-kisses "the sweet
mouth" of the happy and delighted Lodovico.<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> Nor is
she by any means alone, they are all her sisters. Lydia<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>
is even more wily, Bartolommea more shameless.<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>And if the women are thus joyful, lustful, and cunning,
the husbands are fools. Yet Boccaccio knows well how
to draw the honest peasant, the hard-working artisan, the
persistent and adventurous merchant, and a harder thing&mdash;the
man of good society, such as Federigo degli
Alberighi,<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> when he will.</p>

<p>What he cannot do is to compose a tragedy; he has
not a sufficiently virile moral sense for it, and so just
there he fails with the rest of his Latin brethren. But as
a writer of comedy he is one of the greatest masters;
and as a master of comedy he was in some degree at the
mercy both of it and of his audience. This may excuse
him perhaps for his too persistent stories about adulteries.
The deceived husband was always a comic figure; he
probably always will be. This being granted, we shall not
judge the women of Boccaccio's time by his tales, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>might seem that we should discount in the same way his
stories about the clergy. Like every other comic master,
he naturally finds some of his choicest material among
them, who always have been, are now, and ever will be a
never-failing source of amusement. But here we must go
warily, for Boccaccio's treatment of the clergy might
almost be said to exhaust what little moral indignation he
was possessed of. "I have spoken the truth about the
friars," he tells us with an immense relief in the conclusion
to his work, and if he had not time, courage, or opportunity
to tell us the truth about the monks, the nuns, and
the secular clergy, he has left us, it must be confessed,
some very remarkable evidence. His whole attitude of
attack is different when he exposes the clergy; moreover,
while we have no evidence at all in support of his supposed
representation of the married woman as universally adulterous&mdash;and
it may be questioned whether it was his intention
to leave us with any such impression&mdash;we have ample
evidence from the best possible sources of the frightful
wickedness, immorality, and general rottenness of the
clergy, both religious and secular, monks, friars, nuns,
and priests. We have only to consult the pages of S.
Catherine of Siena<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> to find every separate accusation
of Boccaccio's confirmed ten times over, with a hundred
others added to them which he has failed to bring forward.
Nor is it only in the mouth of S. Catherine that Boccaccio
is justified. Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, had long ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
informed Innocent IV that the Curia was the source of all
that vileness which rendered the priesthood a reproach to
Christianity. Alexander IV himself described the corruption
of the people as proceeding from the clergy.
What this had become after the Black Death we know
not only from Boccaccio, Petrarch, and S. Catherine, but
from every writer of the time. The Church was rotten to
the core, she seemed about to sink for ever into the pit
of her abominations. Consider, then, what such a beast
as the priest of Varlungo must have been in a village;
consider the rector of Fiesole. Is Boccaccio's irony too
bitter? Is it any wonder that Monna Belcolore answers
the wolf of Varlungo, "There is never a one of you priests
but would overreach the very devil."</p>

<p>As for the friars, we should not recognise in any one of
them the brother of S. Francis or S. Dominic. Consider
them then: Fra Cipolla<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> is a lovely rogue of the best; who
more cunning than Fra Alberto da Imola;<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> who more
eagerly wily than Fra Rinaldo;<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> who more goat-like and
concupiscent than Fra Rustico? The only son of S.
Francis illumined with light and piety is the confessor of
Ser Ciappelletto,<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> and he has no name, and is, I fear,
quickly forgotten.</p>

<p>Nor have we better news of the nuns<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> or the monks,<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>
and indeed, so far as the clergy are concerned, the
<cite>Decameron</cite> is as eager in its attack on wickedness as the
<cite>Divine Comedy</cite> itself, though its justice is tempered with
kindness and its scorn with a sort of pity, a sort of
understanding.</p>

<p>And indeed, if we compare the book with that of
Dante, a much greater man, it holds its own because
of its humanity. Dante puts the centre of gravity into
the next world. He hates this world almost without ceasing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>and has dared to arraign it before his hatred. His
satire is cruel, unjust, intolerant, and vindictive. Of
course we are wont to excuse all this on account of the
genius which it expressed, of its sincerity and beauty of
form. Boccaccio, however, with less than half Dante's
genius, was not subject to his madness. He was content
to satirise what is bad, the bad customs of ecclesiastics
and of fools; but he excuses and pardons all too because
of the "misfortunes of the time," and above all he understands.</p>

<p>But if we may not compare the <cite>Decameron</cite>, the Human
Comedy, with the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> of Dante as a work of
art, we may claim for it that it was the greatest though
not quite the first prose work in the Tuscan tongue. But
Italian prose maybe said to consist of the <cite>Decameron</cite> alone
for a hundred years after Boccaccio's death. It is written
in a very beautiful but very complicated style, a sort of
poetical prose&mdash;exquisite, it is true, but often without simplicity.
Yet who will dare to attack it? It has justified
itself, if need be, as every great work has done, by its
appeal to mankind, its utter indifference to criticism.</p>

<p>That the <cite>Decameron</cite>, though widely read and enthusiastically
received, was censured very strongly in its own
day we gather from the Proem to the Fourth Day and
from the Conclusion to the work; while later the book did
not escape the knife of the Church, though it was never
suppressed.<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> That it was enthusiastically received in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
day we know from contemporary documents,<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> and though
Petrarch failed to understand it, he praised it in certain
places, which were those, it seems, that were the most
rhetorical. He translated the last tale of Griselda into
Latin, however, but as he tells us, he had known this for
many years. Petrarch, however, stood alone; from the
day the <cite>Decameron</cite> was finished its influence both in Italy
and abroad was very great.</p>

<p>The original manuscript has disappeared, and the oldest
we possess seems to be that written in 1368 by Francesco
Mannelli, though the later Hamilton MS. now in Berlin is
the better of the two.<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> More than ten editions were, however,
printed in the fifteenth century, and some seventy-seven
in the sixteenth; while there is not a <i>Novelliere</i> in
Italian literature for many centuries who has not inspired
himself with the <cite>Decameron</cite>. Its fortune abroad was
almost equally good. Hans Sachs, Molière, La Fontaine,<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
Lope de Vega, to mention only European names, were in
its debt; and in England our greatest poets have drawn
from it, once the form and often the substance of their
work. One has only to name Chaucer, Sir Philip Sidney,
Shakespeare, Dryden,<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Keats,<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> and Tennyson<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> to suggest
England's debt to Boccaccio. And although our prose
literature, strangely enough, produced no great original
example of this school of fiction, its influence was shown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>by the number of translations and imitations of the "mery
bookes of Italy," when, according to Ascham, "a tale of
Bocace was made more account of than a story out of
the Bible."<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>In his <cite>Praise of Poets</cite>, Thomas Churchyard, referring to
Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"In Italy of yore did dwell</p>
<p class="verse">Three men of special spreete,</p>
<p class="verse">Whose gallant stiles did sure excell,</p>
<p class="verse">Their verses were so sweet"</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Of these three great Italians Dante was by far the least
known, and William Thomas, in his <cite>Dictionarie</cite> (1550)
defines "Dante Aldighieri" as "the name of a famous
poet in the Italian tongue," while he does not think it
necessary to explain who Petrarch and Boccaccio are.<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>
Sir Philip Sidney, it is true, refers to Dante several times,
with the other two, and even mentions Beatrice in his
<cite>Defence of Poesie</cite>, yet there is no trace of Dante's influence
in his work. The only writer after Chaucer who shows
internal evidence of knowing Dante fairly well is Sir John
Harrington, the translator of <cite>Orlando Furioso</cite>. In his
<cite>Apology of Poetry</cite> he refers to Dante's relations to Virgil,
and in the <cite>Allegorie</cite> of the fourth book of his translation
he translates the first five lines of the <cite>Inferno</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>That Boccaccio was well known in England, at least by
name, in the fourteenth century, seems certain. Sacchetti
(1335-1400) in the Proemio to his <cite>Novelle</cite> writes as
follows: "... and taking into consideration the excellent
Florentine poet Messer Giovanni Boccaccio, who
wrote the Book of the Hundred Tales in one material
effort of his great intellect, ... that (book) is so generally
published and sought after, that even in France and
England they have translated it into their language ...
and I, Franco Sacchetti, though only a rude and unrefined
man, have made up my mind to write the present work."
All trace of any such translation, if indeed it was ever
made, has been lost.<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> In fact, it might seem that the only
man in England at that time really capable of carrying
out such a task, worthily at least, was Geoffrey Chaucer,
who, though for some reason we can never know he refused
to mention Boccaccio's name, adapted and translated the
<cite>Teseide</cite>, the <cite>Filostrato</cite>, and it seems, three tales from the
<cite>Decameron</cite>&mdash;the first of the Eighth Day, the fifth of the
Tenth Day, and the tenth of the Tenth Day.<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> May it not
have been Chaucer's work to which Sacchetti referred?
It was not until 1566 that any translation even of isolated
stories from the <cite>Decameron</cite> appeared; in that year and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>the following Painter's <cite>Palace of Pleasure</cite> was published,
which contained sixteen stories translated from the <cite>Decameron</cite>.
Then in 1579 came the <cite>Forest of Fancy</cite>, by H. C.,
in which two more appeared, while Tarlton's <cite>News out of
Purgatorie</cite> (1590) contained four more, and the <cite>Cobler of
Caunterburie</cite>, published in the same year, two more. These
and other translations of isolated stories will best be shown
by a table.<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Such were the stories from the <cite>Decameron</cite> that had been
translated in English when in 1620 the first practically
complete edition appeared, translated inaccurately, but
very splendidly, apparently from the French version of
Antoine Le Macon. Isaac Jaggard published it, in folio
in two parts, with woodcuts, and the title bore no
translator's name. In 1625 this edition was reprinted, the
title bearing the legend "Isaac Jaggard for M. Lownes":<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>
other editions appeared in 1655 and 1657 and 1684, making
five editions in all during the seventeenth century. In
1700 Dryden's translations appeared of the <cite>Three Tales:
Decameron</cite>, IV 1, V 1, and V 8. A new translation, practically
complete, appeared in 1702, and was, I think, twice
reprinted in 1722 and 1741. Certainly eight editions were
published in the nineteenth century<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> and two have appeared
already in the twentieth.<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> The first really complete translation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>to appear in English, however, was that of Mr. John
Payne, printed for the Villon Society (1886), but the first
complete translation to pass into general circulation was
that of Mr. J. M. Rigg, 1896-1905, which is rendered with
a careful accuracy and much spirit.</p>

<p>"The ordinary recreations which we have in Winter,"
says Burton in the <cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>, "and in most
solitary times busy our minds with, are Cards, Tables and
Dice, Shovel-board, Chess-play, the Philosopher's game,
Small Trunks, Shuttle-cock, Billiards, Musick, Masks,
Singing, Dancing, Yulegames, Frolicks, Jests, Riddles,
Catches, Purposes, Questions and Commands, Merry Tales
of Errant Knights, Queens, Lovers, Lords, Ladies, Giants,
Dwarfs, Thieves, Cheaters, Witches, Fairies, Goblins,
Friars, etc., such as the old women told [of] Psyche in
Apuleius, Boccaccio's Novels and the rest, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quarum auditione
pueri delectantur, senes narratione</i>, which some delight
to hear, some to tell, all are well pleased with."</p>

<p>Well, after all, we are our fathers' sons, and (God be
thanked) there are still winter evenings in which, while the
rest are occupied with Burton's frolicks and jests, dancing
and singing and card-play, we, in some cosy place, may
still turn the old immortal pages.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_I" id="APPENDIX_I"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">APPENDIX I</a></h2>

<p class="pfs90 w-sp">THE DATES OF BOCCACCIO'S ARRIVAL IN NAPLES AND
OF HIS MEETING WITH FIAMMETTA</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="up">That</span> the date of the arrival of Boccaccio in Naples
commonly accepted, namely the end of 1330, is inadmissible,
has, I think, been proved by <span class="smcap">Della
Torre</span> (<i>op. cit.</i>, caps. ii. and iii.), who gives us many
good reasons to think that the true date was
December 13, 1323. With his conclusions I agree, nor do I
see how they are easily to be put aside.</p>

<p>To begin with, the departure of Idalagos in the <cite>Filocolo</cite><a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> forms
part of the same episode as the birth of the <i>fratellastro</i>, so that
it would seem the two events cannot have been separated by any
great length of time; certainly not by nine years, which would
be the case if Boccaccio really left Florence in 1330, for Francesco
the <i>fratellastro</i> was born in 1321.<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<p>Again, Boccaccio tells us that at the time of his departure
Idalagos was "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">semplice e lascivo</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> which would scarcely be
epithets to apply to a youth of seventeen years. And then, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>though we pass that, what are we to think of a youth of seventeen
who is so mortally afraid of his stepmother and his little
brother, aged say nine, that to save his life, as he thinks, he runs
away? Certainly this youth is very unlike Boccaccio. Whatever
the date may be, then, the year 1330 would seem to be out of
the question.</p>

<p>At that time it was the custom of men to divide human life
into seven ages, as Shakespeare records later. These seven ages
we find were Infanzia, Puerizia, Gioventù or Adolescenza, Virilità,
Vecchiaia, and Decrepitezza. The first three of these ages

<p>Now Boccaccio tells us quite clearly, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">io ... <i>fanciullo</i> cercai
i regni Etrurii, e di quelli <em>in più ferma età</em> venuto, qui</span> [that is to
Naples] <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">venni</span>."<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> That is to say: "I came to Tuscany before I
was seven years old, and during my boyhood (Puerizia) between
the ages of seven and fourteen, between the years 1320-1327, I
came to Naples."</p>

<p>Does that seem a little far-fetched, a little as though we were
trying to prove too much, with such vague words? Let us have
patience. When after six years with the merchant in Naples,
Boccaccio is abandoned by Abrotonia and Pampinea, they appear
to him in a dream and tell him it was not for them he really
sang, but for another. Then there comes to him a dream in
which he sees this other, and recognises her as the lady who
had welcomed him to Naples&mdash;"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">questa era colei, che <em>nella mia
puerizia vegnendo a questi luoghi</em>, apparitami e baciatomi, lieta
m' avea la venuta profferta</span>."<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> Nor does this passage stand alone.
When on Holy Saturday he sees Fiammetta face to face, he
recognises her as the lady who had lately appeared to him it is
true, but first&mdash;"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Questa è colei che <em>nella mia puerizia</em> e non ha
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>gran tempo ancora, m' apparve ne' sonni miei</span>...." Now
<i>puerizia</i>, boyhood, fell, as we have seen, between the ages of seven
and fourteen&mdash;between the years 1320 and 1327 in Boccaccio's
case.</p>

<p>To clinch the matter, as we might think, in the <cite>De Genealogiis</cite>,
xv. 10, Boccaccio tells us that he entered the merchant's office
before he was adolescent&mdash;"adolescentium nondum intrantem,"
that is to say before he was fifteen and before the year 1328. So
that it might seem to be proved not only that he came to Naples
before 1330, but that he came to Naples between the years 1320
and 1327. Now old Boccaccio himself came to Naples in the
autumn of 1327&mdash;did Boccaccio then come with him? This at
first sight seems likely; let us enquire into it.</p>

<p>In the <cite>De Genealogiis</cite>, xv. 10, Boccaccio tells us that he was six
years with the merchant, wasting his time, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sex annis nil aliud
feci quam non recuperabile tempus in vacuum terere</span>." That is
to say, if he came to Naples with his father in 1327, he was still
with the merchant in 1333, when he was twenty years old. But
Benvenuto da Imola<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> seems to tell us that Boccaccio was sixteen
when he began to study Canon Law; in other words, if we read
that author aright, Boccaccio began to study Canon Law in 1329.
This will not square with the theory that he came to Naples in
1327, but it admirably fits our claim that he came to Naples in
1323, and after six years with a merchant began to study Canon
Law in 1329, when he was sixteen years old.</p>

<p>But we know that whatever else may be insecure in this question,
it is at least certain that the departure of Boccaccio for
Naples took place before the meeting with Fiammetta, for it was
in Naples that he first saw her. At first sight this might seem to
help us little, for the date of the meeting with Fiammetta is more
disputed than anything else in Boccaccio's chronology, the date
usually given being either 27th March, 1334, or 11th April,
1338.<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> We do not accept either of these dates. However, let
us examine what evidence we have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>In the introduction to the <cite>Filocolo</cite> Boccaccio tells us that he
first saw and fell in love with Fiammetta on that Holy Saturday
which fell in the sixteenth <i>grado</i> after the sun was entered
into Aries. I give the whole passage, as the argument depends
upon it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p  lang="it" xml:lang="it">"Avvene che un giorno, la cui prima ora Saturno avea signoreggiata,
essendo già Febo co' suoi cavalli al sedecimo grado
del celestiale Montone pervenuto, e nel quale il glorioso partimento
del figliuolo di Giove dagli spogliati regni di Plutone si
celebrava, io, della presente opera componitore, mi trovai in un
grazioso e bel tempio in Partenope, nominato da colui che per
deificarsi sostenne che fosse fatto di lui sacrificio sopra la grata,
e quivi con canto pieno di dolce melodia ascoltava l' uficio che
in tale giorno si canta, celebrato da' sacerdoti successori di colui
che prima la corda cinse umilemente esaltando la povertade quella
seguendo. Ove io dimorando, e già essendo secondo che il mio
intelletto estimava la quarta ora del giorno sopra l' orientale
orizzonte passata, apparve agli occhi miei le mirabile bellezza
della prescritta giovane...."<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p></div>

<p>The whole question is then: on what day did the sun enter
Aries, in other words, on what day did Spring begin. We seem
to be on the point of solving the difficulty by answering that
question&mdash;an easy task&mdash;for sixteen days afterwards in the year
we seek it was Holy Saturday, and Boccaccio then saw Fiammetta
for the first time. The solution is, however, on consideration, not
quite so simple. We have to ask not only when did Spring
begin, but on what day did Boccaccio think it began; when did
he think the sun entered Aries?</p>

<p>As we know, Chaucer, Boccaccio's contemporary, thought
Spring began on 12th March,<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> but Chaucer's "Treatise on the
Astrolabe" was written in 1391, more than fifty years after
the <cite>Filocolo</cite>.</p>

<p>All sorts of opinions have been expressed by scholars as to the
date that was in Boccaccio's mind as that which marked the entry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>of the sun into Aries. Baldelli<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> thinks it was March 21st; Witte<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
and Koerting<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> say the 25th; Casetti<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> says the 14th; and
Landau<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> says the 11th. The whole question is more or less
complicated by the fact that the Julian Calendar was in use.</p>

<p>We shall, then, find ourselves in agreement with many good
scholars if we say that Boccaccio thought Spring began on the
25th March (see <i>infra</i>), and calculating thus, we shall find that
he first met Fiammetta on April 11th, 1338, when he was
twenty-five years old.<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> This, however, is only conjecture.</p>

<p>If we ask ourselves, then, on what day Spring really did begin,
we shall find ourselves in agreement with Casetti, who names
the 14th March. Why should Boccaccio have been ignorant of
this? He cannot have been ignorant of it. Are all his studies
with Calmeta and Andalò di Negro to go for nothing? He
must have known when Spring began better than most men.
If then we take the 14th March as the date and add the sixteen
<i>gradi</i> to it, we arrive at the 30th. Now Holy Saturday fell on
the 30th March in 1331 and in 1336. Which of these two dates
is the true one? The earlier we think.</p>

<p>If for the moment we admit that he came to Naples in 1323,
he must have met Fiammetta in 1331, not in 1336, for he
himself gives us to understand that seven years and four months
passed between his advent and that Holy Saturday.<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> It seems
then most likely that he left home in 1323 and saw Fiammetta
for the first time in 1331. If we argue back from the year 1336
(and, as has been shown, he met Fiammetta certainly either in
1331 or in 1336), we find that he left home in 1329, when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>was sixteen. That would be open to as many objections as the
year 1330 (see <i>supra</i>). Without actual certainty we may
claim that the years 1323 and 1331 that have a secure relationship
exactly fit in with all the secondary evidence that has been
brought to bear upon the argument.</p>

<p>Our conclusions are then: that Boccaccio entered Naples in
December, 1323; that he was with a merchant for six years,
till 1329, in which year he began to study Canon Law. For
sixteen months he had followed this study (so that he left the
merchant in the winter of 1329), when on Holy Saturday,
March 30, 1331, at the age of eighteen, he first saw and fell in
love with Fiammetta.<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>Fra gli ammiratori del nostro Villaggio di Maiano e delle sue
adiacenze fu il nostro celebre maestro della Toscana eloquenza
Messer Giovanni di Boccaccio di Chellino da Certaldo, il quale
fino dalla prima età e dipoi nel fiore della gioventù si trattenne
molto tempo nella piccola villetta unita al podere, che possedeva
suo padre pochi passi sotto il Sobborgo di Corbignano, che per
la misura del suo lo goduto con essa, per il fossato che sbocca in
Mensola, che lo divide, per i confini che lo specificano, e per le
due Cure, una di S. Martino a Mensola, e l' altra di S. Maria
a Settignano che vi esercitano la giurisdizione e vengono a
individuarla altra non può essere che quella di Corbignano dè<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Signori Berti posseduta di presente con titolo Livellare dal
Signor Ottavio Ruggeri, come il tutto si può riscontrare dal
Contratto di vendite della medesima, fatta per rogito di Ser Salvi
Dini esistente all' Archivio Fiorentino del dí 18 Maggio 1336,
allorchè il nostro Boccaccio si ritovava in età d' anni 23. Questa
fiorita età del medesimo e le dolci compagnie di quella villeggiatura,
chi sà che non gli infiammassero il cuore e nella sua
commedia delle Ninfe Fiorentine, lo portassero ad encomiare e
comparire nel Prologo sotto nome d' Ameto e principalmente a
fissare lo sguardo a quella parte "dilettevole di graziose Ville e
di campi fruttiferi copiosa, ove sorge un infruttuoso monte
Corito nominato, prima che Atlante vi salisse; nelle piaggie del
quale fra gli strabocchevoli balzi surgea d' alberi, di querce, di
cerri, e di abeti, un folto bosco e disteso fino alla sommità del
monte. Dalla sua destra un chiaro fiumicello, mosso dalla ubertà
dei monti vicini, fra le pietrose valli, discendeva gridando vesso
il piano: dove giunte le sue acque con l' Arno mescolando il poco
avuto nome perdea." Per il monte di Corito non vi ha dubbio
che egli intenda il monte di Fiesole, poichè nel fine dell' istessa
commedia trattando delle guerre tra i Fiesolani e i Fiorentini
successe nell' anno 1125 allorchè furono distrutti i Fiesolani
colla loro rocca e accomunate le famiglie e l' insegne di questi due
popoli. Egli dice che la fortuna "dante nè principj i beni con
mano troppo larga a quelli di Corito, gli rendè invidiosi e tra
loro determini della Jurisdizione della loro Città, nata mortale
questione, nuove battaglie cominciaron tra popoli," e poco dopo
parlando di Firenze, e de' suoi abitatori dice "che levatosi l' aspro
giogo dè Coritani già sovrastanti per le indebolite virtudi si
rintuzzarono le loro forze, che appena il monte erano usati di
scendere." Per il fiumicello, il quale a chi riguarda il monte di
Fiesole comparisce alla destra si conosce che egli intese il fiume
d' Affrico, che ha l' origine e discende per le balze descritte; et
Ameto chiamò Sarno il fiume d' Arno, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text was 'in ciu Affrico'">in cui Affrico</ins> si sperde
poichè rappresentava tempi così remoti, giusta il parere dello
Storico Malaspina, allorchè il detto fiume non aveva ancora
mutato il suo nome Sarno con quello d' Arno. "Era di piacevoli
seni ed ombra graziosa la selva ripiena d' animali veloci,
fierissimi, e paurosi, e in più parti di se abbondanti fontane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
rigavano le fresche erbette. In questa selva sovente Ameto
vagabondo giovane i Fauni, le Driadi abitatrici del luogo solea
visitare. Et ella forse dalli vicini monti avuta antica origine
quasi da carnalità costretto, di ciò avendo memoria con pietosi
affetti gli onorava talvolta." Dice, che Ameto vagabondo
giovane perchè forse dalli vicini monti avuta antica origine,
quasi da umana simpatia costretto, e de ciò ricordandosi solea
visitare ed onorare talvolta i Fauni e le Driadi abitatrici del
luogo pieno di Ville, di fonti, di seni, e boschetti. E chi ne
assicura, che il Boccaccio non fosse nato nella sua villa di
Corbignano quivi poco distante? Infatti per quanto sia cognita
l' età e in conseguenza la nascita del nostro M<sup>o</sup> Giovanni di
Boccaccio, nulladimeno però fino ad ora ne il Sig<sup>r</sup> Manni,
ne altro Scrittore della sua vita hanno potuto indagare dove ei
nascesse, non essendo stato procreato qual frutto di legittimo
matrimonio, ma bensi quale aborto di malnata passione, come
si può riscontrare dalla dispensa addomandata per farsi cherico,
riferita nella storia d' Avignone e dalla dilui legittimazione narrata
dal Sig<sup>r</sup> Della Rena. Io credo, che raccontandoci in figura
d' Ameto il Boccaccio avere avuta forse l' origine nei colli vicini a
Maiano, e che perciò spinto da natural simpatia andava spesso
a visitare le Ninfe e le Driadi di quelle magioni, abbia voluto
farci comprendere essere egli venuto alia luce nella sua piccola
villetta unita al Podere posto parte nel popolo di S. Martino a
Mensola, e parte di S. Maria a Settignano, e tramezzato dal fosso
che forma con altri due fossi dipoi il fiume di Mensola presso il
Borgo di Corbignano, distante circa a mezzo miglio dalle Ville
di Maiano. Tuttociò si rende <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text was 'vie puì credibile'">vie più credibile</ins>, quanto è naturale
il persuadersi che il dilui genitore abbandonata la sua patria di
Certaldo comprasse tosto quella villetta e podere di Corbignano,
e che poi essendogli nato il nostro Messer Giovanni facesse
acquisto circa al 1314 d' una Casa nella Città di Firenze presso
quella porta, che conduceva alla sua Villetta, come si usava in
quei tempi, e questa casa la scegliesse posta nel popolo di S.
Pier Maggiore in via S. Maria e nel Gonfalone delle Chiavi come si
scuopre dal libro delle Riformagioni segnato R. che tira dal 1313 al
1318 sotto di 10 Ottobre 1318 ove si ordina che detto Boccaccio sia
levato dalla Libra delle gravezze di Certaldo, e resti aggravato in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
quella di Firenze, per essere egli tornato ad abitarvi nel Gonfalone
delle Chiavi dai quattro anni già scorsi. Questa casa del
Boccaccio non può essere altro, che quella posta nel detto popolo
di S. Pier Maggiore nella detta Via S. Maria presso la cantonata
che fa la detta strada con la via del Giardino di proprietà in oggi
dei P. P<sup>i</sup> Minori Conventuali, scoperta da me per mezzo dei
confini d' altra casa che le sta al fianco venduta nè tre Luglio
1333 per rogito di Ser Salvi Dini e descritta come App<sup>o</sup>
"Una Casa posta nel popolo di S. Pier Maggiore, ed in Via
S. Maria cui a primo detta Via, a secondo, la Chiesa di
S. Reparata, a terzo di Ruggero di Scotto o degli Albizi,
a quarto, a tempo d' altra vendita delle medesima, seguita nel
25. Aprile 1326 per rogito de Sig<sup>r</sup> Bonacosa di Compagno
etc. confinava Boccaccio da Certaldo e in oggi gli Eredi di
Cino Bicchierai."</p>

<p>Osservandosi il contorno dei confini di questa Casa venduta si
scuopre esser quella istessa che in' oggi è divenuta dell' Opera
del Duomo che sta in mezzo all' altra, che ora, e fin di quel
tempo è stata posseduta dall' Opera medesima che fa cantonata
in via del Giardino, e dall' altra parte, vale a dire vesso mezzogiorno
resta accanto alia Casa dei P. P<sup>i</sup> di S. Croce di Firenze
presentemente, e che in antico fu di proprietà del Boccaccio il
quale bisogna che la vendesse poco dopo al 1326 poichè avendo
egli emancipato Francesco, altro suo figlio, che si trovava vicino
alia pubertà gli fece comprare nel 31. Agosto 1333 un altra
casa in Firenze nel popolo di S. Felicità per rogito di Ser Salvi
Dini, ove esso con i suoi figli abitò, e di cui parla il Signor
Manni nella sua illustrazione, che confina a primo e secondo Via
a terzo Domenico Barducci, a quarto Vanni di Cera e degli
Eredi di Ghino Canigiani. Lo stesso Boccaccio fece poscia
acquisto d' altra mezza Casa il di 13. Dicembre 1342 pei rogiti di
Sig<sup>ri</sup> Francesco di Ser Matteo, come si riscontra da un Libro
di Gabella di detto tempo esistente nell' Archivio del Monte
Comune di Firenze, la quale penso che sia quella posta nel
popolo di S. Ambrogio donata dipoi alla Compagnia d' Orsanmichele,
come dal registro della medesima principiato nel 1340
a N 133 si vede.</p>

<p>Dopo questa breve digressione torniamo a Fiesole coll' istesso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Giovanni di Boccaccio, il quale non solo nella sua Genealogia
degli Dei, ma ancora nel Ninfale riconosce Atlante per fondatore
della medesima, ed insieme nel suo poema Toscano, primo, che
si trovi alla luce in ottava rima, rappresenta gli amori di Affrico
e Mensola piccoli fiumicelle che irrigano la nostra celebre Campagna
e mette in vista i casi veri, o finti che siano, seguiti nel
contorno di Maiano situato in mezzo a questi due fiumi. Racconta

Presso alla maggior riviera, de cui era situata la casa di <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text was 'Girasone'">Girafone</ins>,
sicchè l' onda che scorrea sanguinosa scuopri all' infelice
padre la disgrazia del figlio; Mensola poi per lo peccato, e lo
timor di Diana e delle Ninfe sue compagne nascosa e palpitante
aspettava l' ora del parto; partori finalmente; ma in quel tempo
appunto, che la Dea Cacciatrice essendo tornata a Fiesole e ne
suoi contorni a rivedere le sue seguaci fra le quali non avendo
ritrovata Mensola piena d' ira e sospetto la ricercava. Mensola
occultò il piccolo figlio in una macchia fra i pruni (onde Pruneo
fu chiamato) e si dette alia fuga; ma per il vagito del bambinello
avendo scoperto Diana il di lei delitto; gridò</p>

<p class="noindent">Questa fonte è l' istessa chiamata modernamente Fonte all' erta,
a piè e nel base di Monte Ceceri situata a Mezzogiorno
e sotto la Villa dei Signori Pitti Gaddi, della qual fontana
ora non se ne veggono che le scomposte mura, le rovine ed i
vestigi nella pubblica strada al principio della costa; ma vivono
persone, che mi hanno assicurato che circa all' anno 1710 ne fu
deviata l' acqua procedente dal vivaio un po superiore alla
medesima e dall' unione di quelle, che vi concorrevano d' altrove
perchè infrigidiva i terreni sottoposti e noceva alle piante e
alle raccolte dell istesso podere. Al tempo del nostro Boccaccio
(chiamerò da qui avanti con tal nome benchè di suo padre il
nostro M<sup>o</sup> Giovanni) io trovo che questo podere con case, vivaio
etc., esistente alla fine del piano di S. Gervasio fu venduto nel
5 Giugno 1370 per rogito di Sig<sup>re</sup> Ristoro di Jacopo da Figline,
da Giovanni di Agostino degli Asini a Messer Bonifazio Lupo
Marchese di Soragona e Cavaliere Parmigiano, che in quel tempo
fu ascritto alla fiorentina cittadinanza, il quale spinto da lodevole
pietà e grata riconoscenza alla repubblica fiorentina ottenne
dalla medesima fino sotto li 23 Dicembre 1377 come attesta
l' Ammirato nel Libro decimo terzo, di poter fondare lo Spedale
in Via S. Gallo di detta città chiamato appunto di Bonifazio dal
nome de sì pio e grato benefattore; fu posto questo Spedale nel
luogo comprato sino ne 2 Febbraio 1309 da Messer Giovanni
del già Migliore dè Chiaramontesi di Firenze per edificare il
Monastero e Convento di S. Maria a Querceto per rogito di Ser
Benedetto di Maestro Martino come si vede dall' Archivio dell' Arcivescovado
e dagli spogli del Migliore, le quale Monache
vi tornarono e vi si trovavano ancora nell' anno della peste del
1348 come per i rogiti di Ser Lando di Ubaldino da Pesciola del
4 Maggio 1336, e di Ser Benvenuto di Cerreto Maggio del dì
24 Marzo 1346, e d' altri si riscontra, e dopo molto tempo
Eugenio Quarto uni ed assegnò al predetto Spedale il detto
monastero e Monache di Querceto quivi contigue come dallo
Zibaldone di No. 90 Del Migliore a 127 e 202 nella Magliabechiana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
si può vedere. Ecco scoperto il luogo ove declamava
Diana (ma senza frutto) se riguardo a Mensola che all' altre
Ninfe di quei contorni, poiche io osservo, che tutti quei villeggianti
s' imparentavano e sposavano le zittelle dei villeggianti
vicini. Partito Africo dalla fonte predetta salendo verso Fiesole,
traversando la costa formata da più effetti della Casa Albizi,
Covoni, Asini ed altre posti tanto nel popolo della Canonica,
che della Badia di Fiesole e di S. Gervasio dei quali per non
tediare non produrrò i Contratti ritrovati, quali Poderi tutti si
denominano Monte negli antichi Istrumenti per essere situati
sul poggio ove risiede in oggi il Convento di S. Domenico.
E dopo tal viaggio giunse il pastorello alla Valle formata da
questo giogo dè Colli di Fiesole; e da quelle degli altri di
Maiano sotto la Doccia, chiamata nel Decamerone la Valle delle
Donne di cui in seguito ragioneremo. Le acque delle superiori
piagge che scorrevano, formavano gli acquitrini, quali si univano
e davano l' origine al fiume d' Affrico ed in uno di questi acquitrini
vidde il pastorelle le Ninfe lavarsi le piante, e che s' involarono
da lui tostochè lo scopersero; onde afflitto e turbato
scese verso la pianura di detta Valle e tornò alla sua magione.
Venere lo speranza, egli si traveste da Ninfa cerca di Mensola,
la ritrova, gira con essa verso le cime del Monte di Fiesole
saettando per giuoco, ritorna al pelago sotto la Doccia nella valle
vede le Ninfe che si bagnavano s' immerge ancor esso con la
compagna nelle acque, e quivi principiano le comuni sciagure.
Questo luogo pare, che sia devenuto cosi famoso nell' antichità
e nei tempi del nostro Boccaccio da potere aver comunicata la
denominazione agli stessi fondi di terreni che lo compongono, o
perchè fosse ivi seguito qualche accidente che avesse dato luogo
al favoloso poema, o perchè la favola istessa sia stata forse
adattata al luogo medesimo. Infatti io ritrovo nei rogiti di Ser
Roberto di Talento da Fiesole del 27 Novembre 1347 e del
28 Maggio 1352 descritto un podere di Tuccio del già Diedi
de Falconieri posto verso Ponente e perciò nel popolo della
Canonica di Fiesole con Case etc. chiamato il Bagno allo
Scopetino, ed in quelli di Ser Giovanni Bencini da Montaione si
vede una reciproca donazione fra Andreola, figlia del già Carlo
dei Pazzi, e Vedova di Piero di Cione Ridolfi e Carlo Pazzi suo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
fratello, di più luoghi, fra i quali si trova un podere nel popolo
di S. Martino a Maiano luogo detto la Valle al Bagno, fino sotto
di II Luglio 1343. Di più nel libro F Primo a ć 76 della
Gabella dei Contratti si osserva nè dì II Dicembre 1349 per
rogito di Ser Francesco di Bruno di Vico Dal Pozzo, che
M<sup>a</sup> Dolce figlia di Mannino e Vedova di Bindo Buonaveri
(famiglia molto illustre di Firenze) vendè a M<sup>a</sup> Simona
Pinzochera di S. Maria Novella, e Sorella di Cenni di Giotto,
ma non del pittore, per fiorini 500 d' oro un podere etc.,
posto nel popolo di S. Martino a Maiano luogo detto la Valle
del Bagno in Affrico. Nel Decamerone veggo descritta dal
Boccaccio questa medesima Valle, e che la medesima adunanza
d' acque in essa valle, che due "di quelle montagnette divideva, e
cadeva giù per balzi di pietra viva, e cadendo facea un rumore a
udire assai dilettevole, e sprizzando parea da lungi ariento vivo,
che d' alcuna cosa premutta minutamente sprizzasse; e come giù
al piccol pian pervenire, così quivi in un bel canaletto raccolta
infino al mezzo del piano velocissima discorreva ed ivi faceva un
piccol laghetto quale talvolta per modo di vivaio fanno ne lor
giardini i Cittadini che di ciò hanno destro." Il podere con casa
etc., etc., posto nel popolo di S. Martino a Maiano che gode di
presente la Signora Berzichelli, Vedova del già Signor Barone
Agostino Del Nero, nella Valle d' Ameto e delle Donne, e
presso addove s' unisce il poggio della Doccia con quel di Maiano,
si chiama il Vivaio, e più Vivaietti e Acquitrini si trovano in
quella valle sovrabbondante di acque, le quali dettero varie
denominazioni ad esse allusive di luoghi circonvicini, e credo,
che il detto luogo sia il medesimo, che donò una volta M<sup>a</sup>
Andreola de' Pazzi al suo fratello, e dipoi pervenuto in M<sup>a</sup> Dolce,
Vedova del Bonavieri, lo vendè alla figlia di Giotto suddetto,
situato d' appresso all' altro del Falconieri. Quest' effetto
acquistarono i Signori Del Nero del Sig<sup>r</sup> Jacopo del Feo nel 1568
in cui era passato nel 1559 dal Sig<sup>r</sup> Niccolo di Filippo Valori, e
questo lo avea descritto in suo conto alla Decima del 1498 nel
Gonfalone delle Chiavi a 176. Questo Jacopo di Feo di Savona
ebbe per moglie Caterina Sforza de' Duchi di Milano naturale,
Vedova Girolamo Riario Signore di Forlì e poi rimaritata a Gio.
di Pier Francesco de' Medici e Nonna percio di Cosimo I Gran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Duca di Toscana. Mensola intimorita varca il poggio in cui
risiede Maiano e si nasconde nel suo refugio sotto le cave in
faccia a Levante ed al piano di Novoli presso del Fiume, Affrico
all' incontro scende verso la pianura, e dopo esser tornato e
ritornato poi vesso del pelago disperato per non avere rintracciata
la Ninfa si trafigge col proprio dardo vicino alla magione di
Girafone suo padre posta sul ramo maggiore, uno chiamato
Affrico e l' altro Affricuzzo, che poi s' uniscono insieme formandone
il suo fiume presso allo sbocco della valle predetta. Altro per
ora non resta da notarsi sopra la Topografia del racconto, poichè
nato il figlio Pruneo e trasmutata da Diana in pena del delitto
nel fiume che porta il suo nome, Mensola sua Madre, e dalla
disperazione il padre in quello d' Affrico, fu chiamato dipoi questo
pargoletto Pruneo dall' essere stato scoperto fra i pruni dalla
Dea. Nel corso degli anni comparve a Fiesole Atlante ed
edificò quella Città, ed a questo fanciullo, già fatto adulto, diede
per moglie Tironea, e per dote tutto il paese collocato fra il
Fiume Mensola e quel di Mugnone.</p>

Robert, which has been published. The Signoria on April 12, 1329, write
to King Robert that the lack of corn in the city is so great as to cause fear
of tumult; wherefore they pray him to order the captains of his ships to
send certain galleys they had taken with corn to Talamone, where they
might buy what they needed. Under this letter is written: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ad infra

Orlandini et Acciaiolo de Acciaiolis, et mandatum est et scriptum, quod

If Antona Traversi has disposed of Corazzini's assertions, Crescini seems

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> All the dates and facts so carefully established by Crescini and Della
Torre are really dependent on the date of Boccaccio's birth, 1313, being the
true one. This is the corner-stone of their structure. But the story of his
illegitimacy and foreign birth was current long before this date was
established. It was the commonly received opinion. Why? Doubtless
because Boccaccio himself had practically stated so in the <cite>Filocolo</cite> and the
<cite>Ameto</cite>. That Filippo Villani's Italian translator was dependent on these
allegories for his story seems to be proved (cf. <span class="smcap">Della Torre</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 30);
so probably was the general public. The question remains: Was Boccaccio
speaking the mere truth concerning himself in these allegories? Filippo
Villani himself, as we have seen, believed that he was born at Certaldo; so
did Domenico Aretino. For myself, I do not think that enough has been
allowed for the indirect influence of Fiammetta in the <cite>Filocolo</cite> and the <cite>Ameto</cite>.
They were written for her&mdash;to express his love for her. She was the illegitimate
daughter of King Robert of Naples by the wife of the nobleman
Conte d'Aquino&mdash;a woman of French extraction. It is strange, then, that
Boccaccio's story of his birth in the allegories should so closely resemble
hers. She doubtless thought herself a very great lady, and was probably
prouder of her royal blood than a legitimate princess would have been. But
Boccaccio was just the son of a small Florentine trader; and he was a Poet.
To proclaim himself&mdash;half secretly&mdash;illegitimate was a gain to him, a gain in
romance. How could a youthful poet, in love with a princess too, announce
himself as the son of a petty trader, a mere ordinary bourgeois, to a lady so
fine as the blonde Fiammetta? Of course he could not absolutely deny that
this was so, especially after his father's visit (1327), and also we must
remember that the Florentine trader held, or is supposed to have held, quite
a good social position even in feudal Naples. Nevertheless his bourgeois
birth did not please the greatest story-teller of Europe. So he invented a
romantic birth&mdash;he too would be the result of a love-intrigue, even as
Fiammetta was. And because he loved her, and therefore wished to be as
close to her and as like her as possible, he too would have a French mother.
Suppose all this to be true, and that after all Boccaccio is the son of
Margherita, the wife of his father; that he was born in wedlock in 1318; that he
met Fiammetta not on March 30, 1331 (see <a href="#APPENDIX_I">Appendix I</a>), but on March 30,
1336, and that he told Petrarch he was born in 1313 because he knew his
father was in Paris at that date&mdash;this last with his usual realism to clinch
the whole story he had told Fiammetta.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> It seems strange that Boccaccio did not follow the Via Francigena for
Rome, as Henry VII and all the emperors did, till we remember that the
Pope was in Avignon and the City a nest of robbers. The route given above
is, according to De Blasiis, the one he took, though of course there is no
certainty about it. Cf. <span class="smcap">De Blasiis</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 513-14.
</p>
<p>
There is also this to be considered that, according to Della Torre's theory,
which we accept, Boccaccio's journey took place in December, 1323. But Mr.
Heywood informs me that at that date the country about Perugia was in
a state of war. Spoleto was then being besieged by the Perugians, and
the Aretine Bishop was perpetually organising raids and incursions for
her relief. In the autumn Città di Castello had revolted and given herself to
the Tarlati, and even if (owing to the season of the year and the consequent
scarcity of grass for the horses of the <i>milites</i>) military operations were impossible
on a large scale in the open country, the whole <i>contado</i> must still have
been full of marauding bands. This route then via Perugia would have been
dangerous if not impossible. The explanation may be that the Florentines
and Sienese were allied with the Perugians. Certainly in the spring of 1324
there were Florentine troops in the Perugian camp before Spoleto. Perhaps
the boy found protection by travelling with some of his military compatriots.
In 1327 (see <i>infra</i>) the route suggested by <span class="smcap">De Blasiis</span> and accepted by <span class="smcap">Della
Torre</span> would have been reasonable enough.</p></div>

da Borgo Sansepolcro. He adds that this man was in Paris in 1329, and
that Boccaccio <i>there in that year</i> began work under him. In defence of
this theory he cites a letter from Boccaccio himself to Niccola Acciaiuoli of
28th August, 1341, in which he says: "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Nè è nuova questa speranza, ma
antica; perocchè altra non mi rimase, poichè il reverendo mio padre e
signore, maestro Dionigi, forse per lo migliore, da Dio mi fu tolto</span>." (Cf.
<span class="smcap">Corazzini</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 18.) We may dismiss Baldelli's argument, for we have
decided that Boccaccio was in Naples in 1329, when he began the study of
Canon Law. But the conjecture itself gains a certain new strength from
the fact that Roberti was a professor in Naples. (See <span class="smcap">Renier</span>, <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Vita
Nuova e La Fiammetta</cite>, Torino, 1879. Cf. <span class="smcap">Gigli</span>, <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">I sonetti Baiani del

1328, however, he proves to have been in Paris, and in fact he did not arrive in
Naples till 1338. As I have said, the course lasted six years, and even
though we concede that Boccaccio began his studies under Roberti in 1338,
we know that three years later, in 1341, Roberti died (<span class="smcap">Della Torre</span>,
<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 146). Besides, in 1341 Boccaccio had returned to Florence.
Roberti seems, indeed, to have been the protector rather than the master of
Boccaccio, even as Acciaiuoli was, and it is for this reason that Boccaccio
alludes to him in writing to Acciaiuoli in 1341 when Roberti was dead. The
doctors in Naples in 1329 are named by <span class="smcap">De Blasiis</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 149. Among
them were Giovanni di Torre, Lorenzo di Ravello, Giovanni di Lando,
Niccola Rufolo, Biagio Paccone, Gio. Grillo, Niccola Alunno.</p></div>

he carried out his mission excellently. He had already travelled much, and
after his embassy seems to have gone to Cyprus (<cite>Genealogiis, u.s.</cite>). He
passed his last years at the court of King Robert in Naples, who appointed
him astrologer and physician to the court. His pay was six ounces of gold
annually (<span class="smcap">Bertolotto</span>, <i>u.s.</i>). He died in the early summer of 1334. He
was a learned astronomer and astrologer, and probably one of the most

Then come the words I for one find so suspicious concerning his birth. In
order, he says, to bring her nearer to him, he thinks of his birth which,
different in social position as they are, was not unlike hers in its romance. His
mother was noble, he tells her, and he feels this nobility in his heart. "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ma

remember, however, that he was connected with the Bardi who in 1339 had,
with the Peruzzi, lent Edward III of England 1,075,000 florins. As we know,
this sum was never repaid, and the transaction ruined the lenders. Boccaccino
himself seems to have been already short of money in 1336, when he sold
Casa di Boccaccio.</p></div>

Giovanni declares this was the justice of heaven upon him for the desertion

his father for this. Yet, like a good son, he obeyed the summons, and
says later that "we ought to learn to bear the yoke of our fathers, and should
honour with the greatest reverence their trembling old age." We believe
Margherita died in 1339. The last document we have which speaks of her

the story, because it seems to me certain that in Naples he must have seen or
heard these poems. The Provençal troubadours, especially Rambaldo di
Vaqueiras, sang the loves of Florio and Biancofiore, and Boccaccio himself in
the <cite>Filocolo</cite> affirms that the legend was known and popular in Naples. It
has been contended by <span class="smcap">Clerc</span>, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Discours sur l'état des lettres au XIV. siècle</cite> in

poems. This cannot be upheld. The legend was everywhere in the Middle
Age. It was derived from a Greek romance, and many of the happenings
and descriptions used by Boccaccio are to be found in the Greek romances.

I do not believe it possible to give their true order, because they

certain that the <cite>Filostrato</cite> is the first of his long poems. That no work was
completed in Naples I think equally certain; but it is possible that the
<cite>Ameto</cite>, begun in Florence, was finished before any other book. The
<cite>Filostrato</cite> was begun in Naples, but it s so much finer than the <cite>Filocolo</cite> or
the <cite>Ameto</cite>, and is perhaps the finest work of his youth, that many critics have

<p><a name="Footnote_320" id="Footnote_320"></a><a href="#FNanchor_320"><span class="label">[320]</span></a> Cf. <span class="smcap">W. Heywood</span>, <cite>Palio and Ponte</cite> (Methuen, 1904), pp. 7-9. These
races or <i>palii</i> seem to have originated in the thirteenth century (cf. <span class="smcap">Villani</span>,
<cite>Cronica</cite>, Lib. I, cap. 60, and <span class="smcap">Dante</span>, <cite>Paradiso</cite>, <span class="smcap">xvi</span> 40-2). Benvenuto da Imola
says, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Est de more Florentiæ, quod singulis annis in festo Iohannis
Baptistæ currant equi ad brevium in signum festivæ laetitiæ</span>..." He
goes on to say that the race was run from S. Pancrazio, the western ward of
the city, through the Mercato Vecchio, to the eastern ward of S. Piero.
Goro di Stazio Dati, who died in 1435, thus describes the <i>palio</i> of S. John
in Florence. I quote Mr Heywood's excellent redaction from <span class="smcap">Dati's</span> <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Storia
di Firenze</cite> (Florence, 1735), pp. 84-9, in his <cite>Palio and Ponte, u s</cite>
"... Thereafter, dinner being over, and midday being past, and the folk having
rested awhile according to the pleasure of each of them; all the women and
girls betake themselves whither the horses which run the palio will pass. Now
these pass through a straight street, through the midst of the city, where are
many dwellings, beautiful, sumptuous houses of good citizens, more than in any
other part thereof. And from one end of the city to the other, in that straight
street which is full of flowers, are all the women and all the jewels and rich
adornments of the city; and it is a great holiday. Also there are always many
lords and knights and foreign gentlemen, who come every year from the surrounding
towns to see the beauty and magnificence of that festival. And
there, through the said Corso, are so many folk that it seemeth a thing
incredible, the like whereof he who hath not seen it could neither believe nor
imagine. Thereafter, the great bell of the Palagio de' Signori is tolled three
times, and the horses, ready for the start, come forth to run. On high upon the
tower, may be seen, by the signs made by the boys who are up there, that is of
such an one and that of such an one (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">quello è del tale, e quello è del tale</i>).
And all the most excellent race-horses of the world are there, gathered together
from all the borders of Italy. And that one which is the first to reach
the Palio is the one which winneth it. Now the Palio is borne aloft upon a
triumphal car, with four wheels, adorned with four carven lions which seem
alive, one upon every side of the car, drawn by two horses, with housings with the
emblem of the Commune thereon, and ridden by two varlets which guide them.
The same is a passing rich and great Palio of fine crimson velvet in two palii,
and between the one and the other a band of fine gold a palm's width, lined
with fur from the belly of the ermine and bordered with miniver fringed with
silk and fine gold; which, in all, costeth three hundred florins or more....
All the great piazza of S. Giovanni and part of the street is covered with blue
hangings with yellow lilies; the church is a thing of marvellous form, whereof
I shall speak at another time...." Boccaccio must often have seen these
races. Cf. <cite>Decameron</cite>, Day VI, Nov. 3.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_322" id="Footnote_322"></a><a href="#FNanchor_322"><span class="label">[322]</span></a> We do not know when, if at all at this time, Boccaccio returned to
Naples. The only testimony by which Baldelli, Witte, and Koerting hold
that he was in Naples in 1345 is the passage in the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Casibus Virorum
Illustrium</cite>, Lib. IX, cap. 25, where he narrates, as though he had been
present on the occasion, the terrible end of Philippa la Catanese (see <i>infra</i>).
Witte, however, wishes to support this evidence by an interpretation
of certain words in the letter to Zanobi, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Longum tempus effluxit</i> (see <span class="smcap">Corrazini</span>,
<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 33). Hortis, Gaspary, and Hauvette, however, assert that
in the <cite>De Casibus, u.s.</cite>, Boccaccio does not actually say he was present on the
occasion mentioned, but only says, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quæ fere vidi</i>, while the passage in the
letter to Zanobi, they say, refers to Acciaiuoli. Lastly, Hecker observes that
the words of Boccaccio seem to prove that he was in Naples in 1345. In fact,
speaking of the condemnation and torture of the Catanese as accomplice in
the assassination of King Andrew he says: "quædam auribus, quædam
oculis sumpta meis describam."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_324" id="Footnote_324"></a><a href="#FNanchor_324"><span class="label">[324]</span></a> Gio. Villani, who did not love the Angevins, tells us that King Robert
was full of every virtue, admitting, however, that in his last years he was very
avaricious; and in this he agrees with Boccaccio. He says, however, that
he was the wisest monarch of Christendom after Charlemagne. Boccaccio too
calls him Solomon. In a poem attributed to Convenevole da Prato he is
hailed as the sovereign of United Italy. But it is to Petrarch he owes his
fame. Robert was a great patron of the Franciscans, then utterly rotten.
Boccaccio doubtless saw enough in Naples to give him justification for his
stories later. See <i>infra</i>.</p></div>

"Immediately he was summoned by them he went into the gallery or
promenade which is before the chamber. Then certain men placed their
hands over his mouth so that he could not cry out, and in this act they so
pressed their iron gauntlets that their print and character were manifest after
death. Others placed a rope round his neck in order to strangle him, and
this likewise left its mark; others '<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vero receperunt eum pro genitalia, et adeo
traxerunt, quod multi qui dicebant se vidisse retulerunt mihi quod transcendebant
genua</span>', while others tore out his hair, dragged him, and threw
him into the garden. Some say with the rope with which they had strangled
him they swung him as if hanging over the garden. It was further related
to us that they intended to throw him into a well, and thereafter to give it out
he had left the Kingdom ... and this would have been carried out had not
his nurse quickly come upon the scene." Cf. <span class="smcap">Baluzius</span>, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vitæ Paparum

<p><a name="Footnote_331" id="Footnote_331"></a><a href="#FNanchor_331"><span class="label">[331]</span></a> e.g. another account states that "a conspiracy was formed against the
young Andrew, and it is said, with some truth, that the Queen was the soul
of it. One evening in September, 1345, the court being at the Castello of
Aversa, a chamberlain entered the royal apartment, where Andrew was with
the Queen, to announce to them that despatches of great importance were
arrived from Naples. Andrew went out immediately, and as he passed
through the salon which separated his room from the Queen's, he was seized
and hanged from the window of the palace by a golden rope said to have been
woven by the Queen's hands, and there he was left for two days. The Queen,
who was, or pretended to be, stupefied with horror, returned to Naples. No
real attempt, even at the behest of the Pope, was made to find the assassins."
The Queen was within three months of the birth of her child when the murder
occurred. She gained nothing by Andrew's death but exile. The murderers,
so far as we can judge now, were undoubtedly the Catanese group in danger
of losing their positions at court.</p></div>

Boccaccio's personal relations with Queen Giovanna. By some he is said to
have been her lover, by others to have been in her debt for the suggestion of
the scheme of the <cite>Decameron</cite> so far as it is merely a collection of merry tales.
These tales he is supposed to have told her. No evidence is to be found for

translated this letter into Italian: see <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lettere di Fr. Petrarca volgarizz. Delle

ferme ætate, qua tu ibi agebas cum antiquo plagæ illius domino eius avo qui
nunc præsidet." It is Fracassetti who dates this letter 1365 (Baldelli dates in
1362, and Tiraboschi in 1367). If, as we believe, Fracassetti is right, then
Boccaccio must have been in Ravenna in 1346, for in 1365 Guido da Polenta
ruled there, the son of Bernardino who died in 1359, the son of Ostasio, who
died November 14, 1346. Boccaccio had relations in Ravenna. In the
proem to the <cite>De Genealogiis</cite> he tells us that Ostasio da Polenta induced him
to translate Livy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_335" id="Footnote_335"></a><a href="#FNanchor_335"><span class="label">[335]</span></a> Yet there may be something in it. Baldelli tells us that he wrote the
<cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita di Dante</cite> in 1351, and in 1349 we find him in communication with
Petrarch. That Beatrice di Dante was in Ravenna in 1346 seems certain.
<span class="smcap">Pelli</span>, <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Memorie per servire alla vita di Dante</cite> (Firenze, 1823), p. 45, says:
"As for the daughter Beatrice ... one knows that she took the habit of a
religious in the convent of S. Stefano detto dell' Uliva in Ravenna." We
know from a document seen by Pelli that in 1350 the Or San Michele Society
sent Beatrice ten gold florins by the hand of Boccaccio. What I suggest
is that Boccaccio found her in Ravenna in 1346 very poor. He represented
the facts to the Or San Michele Society, who, after the Black Death of 1348,
had plenty of money in consequence of all the legacies left them and, as is
well known, were very free with their plenty.

<p>
I give the document Pelli saw as he quotes it. He says he found it in
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">un libro d' entrata ed uscita del 1350 tra gli altri esistenti nella cancelleria
de' capitani di Or San Michele risposto nell' armadio alto di detta cancelleria</span>."
There, he says, is written the following disbursement in the month of
September, 1350: "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">A Messer Giovanni di Bocchaccio ... fiorini dieci
d' oro, perchè gli desse a suora Beatrice figliuola che fu di Dante Alleghieri,
monaca nel monastero di S. Stefano dell' Uliva di Ravenna</span>," etc. See also

one in 1347 before the Black Death, and one after it in 1350. Hortis tells
us that this <cite>Eclogue</cite> is certainly dated 1348 (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 5, n. 4). It therefore
must allude to the first descent. This is confirmed, as Hortis points out, by
the poems themselves. (1) By the chronological order in which Boccaccio
treats of events in the <cite>Eclogues</cite>. The first two deal with his love, and those
immediately following the third, of the events of 1348. (2) By the contents
of the third <cite>Eclogue</cite> itself, which deals first with the happiness of Naples
under King Robert, with his death, the murder of Andrew, and the descent of
King Louis, his passage, as we shall see, through Forlì in 1347, whence
Francesco degli Ordelaffi set out with him for Lower Italy: all of which
happened not in the second, but in the first (1347) descent of King Louis.</p></div>

he says: "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">E se io ho il vero inteso, perciocchè in que' tempi io non ci era, io
odo, che in questa città avvenne a molti nell' anno pestifero del MCCCXLVIII,
che essendo soprappresi gli uomini dalla peste, e vicini alla morte, ne furon più
e più, i quali de' loro amici, chi uno e chi due, e chi più ne chiamò, dicendo,
vienne tale e tale; de' quali chiamati e nominati assai, secondo l' ordine
tenuto dal chiamatore, s' eran morti, e andatine appresso al chiamatore</span>...."
This might seem evidence enough that Boccaccio was not in Florence in 1348,
for he expressly says so. There is a passage, however, in the <cite>Decameron</cite> Introduction
where he seems to say that he was in Florence; but as we shall see,
we misunderstand him. He says: "So marvellous is that which I have now
to relate that had not many, <em>and I among them</em>, observed it with their own
eyes I had hardly dared to credit it...." He then goes on to tell us
(assuring us again that he had seen it himself) that one day two hogs came
nosing among the rags of a poor wretch who had died of the disease, and
immediately they "gave a few turns and fell down dead as if from poison...."
But this might have happened in Naples or Forlì quite as well as in Florence.
It is only right to add that the Moutier edition of the <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Comento sopra Dante</cite>
notes that the MS. from which it is printed reads 1340 instead of 1348 in the
passage already quoted. This may or may not be an error. There was a

verses and letters. Sansovino, however, thinks B. was a successful lover of
Fiammetta. Betussi came to think the same, so did Nicoletti, and so did
Zilioli. Mazzuchelli, however, does not believe it. Tiraboschi does not

according to an old writer of 1310 (Cod. Nazionale di Firenze, II, ii. 84),
"They say the philosophers say there are four ages; they are adolescence,
youth, age, and old age. The first lasts till twenty-five or thirty, the second
till forty or forty-five, the third till fifty-five or sixty, the fourth till death.

they consider it a mere fantasy, not referring to any real love affair. Cf. <span class="smcap">Crescini</span>,

in <cite>Filocolo</cite> (Moutier), Lib. IV, p. 94. Sonnet c. also deals with a widow:
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">il brun vestire ed il candido velo</span>." Who this widow really may be is an insoluble
problem. If it be the lady of the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>, she would seem to be the
wife of Antonio Pucci, for sonnet ci. is dedicated "ad Antonio Pucci." Sonnets
lxiv., lxv., seem to refer to the same affair. As to sonnets xii. and xvii.,
the first is a fantasy and the second refers to Fiammetta in my judgment.</p></div>

late, "the late ambassador." In November, as we shall see, Boccaccio was
back in Florence. In the sense of "late" we find the "olim" used in the document
already quoted in which Giovanni is appointed guardian of his brother
Jacopo (<i>supra</i>, cap. x. n. 4): "... <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et heredis D. Bicis olim matris suæ</span>," <i>i.e.</i>

(Firenze, 1827), goes further than Baldelli and is in evident error. He connects
this embassy of 1350 with the descent of King Louis of Hungary. This
is impossible. That Boccaccio did meet King Louis in Forlì, and that he
accompanied him with "suo signore" Francesco degli Ordelaffi into Campania
is certain, as we have seen (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>); but that was in 1347, not in
1350, and when he was a visitor at Forlì, not when he was Florentine ambassador
there. How could he call Ordelaffo "suo signore" when he was the servant
of Florence? And how could he follow Ordelaffo and the King, when he was
ambassador, without the permission of Florence? Moreover, according to
Ciampi, all this occurred, not in 1347, but in 1350. Now in May, 1350, King
Louis was in Aversa, and from February, 1350, Ordelaffo was fighting the
Papal arms in Romagna, which had been turned against him on account of
the rebellion of the Manfredi of Faenza, which he was supposed to have
instigated. We see him victor in fight after fight; he took Bertinoro in May,
Castracaro in July, Meldola in August, and the war continued throughout
1351 and longer. In 1350 then neither did the King descend into Italy nor
did Ordelaffo accompany him. These things happened in 1347. Besides, in
February, 1350, Boccaccio was in accord with Niccolò Acciaiuoli and, as we
have seen, assisted as witness at the donation of Prato. Cf. <span class="smcap">Tanfani</span>, <cite>Niccolò

<p><a name="Footnote_406" id="Footnote_406"></a><a href="#FNanchor_406"><span class="label">[406]</span></a> It seems certain that they had been in correspondence for some years,
perhaps for more than fifteen. In the letter to Boccaccio of January 7, 1351,
Petrarch speaks of a poem that Boccaccio had long since sent him (? 1349)
(<cite>Famil.</cite>, XI, 1); while in the letter to Franceschino da Brossano, written
after Petrarch's death in 1374, Boccaccio says "I was his for forty years
or more" (<span class="smcap">Corazzini</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 382). This would seem to mean he
had loved his work for so long, and brings us to 1341-4. It still seems to
me just doubtful whether this meeting in Florence in 1350 was their first
encounter. As I have said, Petrarch came to Florence in October; by
November 2 he was in Rome, whence he wrote Boccaccio on that date an
account of his journey. Now as we shall presently see, in a letter written much
later (<cite>Epist. Fam.</cite>, XXI, 15), he distinctly says that he first met Boccaccio,
who had come to meet him when he was hurrying across Central Italy <em>in midwinter</em>.
No one, least of all an Italian and a somewhat scrupulous scholar,
would call October 15 midwinter. Perhaps then it will be said that he met
him on his return from Rome in December. But already in November he is
writing to Boccaccio&mdash;we have the letter&mdash;in the most familiar and affectionate
terms. Can it be that they met after all (see <i>supra</i>, pp. 60 and 111) in 1341 or
perhaps in 1343? The problem seems insoluble on our present information.</p></div>

I see no honour in the affair at all. She was asking Petrarch to do
her an inestimable service by bolstering up her third-rate university. In
order to get him to do this, she was willing to pay back what she had stolen
and (a poor gift when she was begging for foreigners as citizens) to repeal
the edict of banishment against him. Petrarch treated the whole impudent
attempt to get round him in the right way. And Florence, when she found
nothing was to be got out of him, repealed the repeal. But surely we know
the Florentines!</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_442" id="Footnote_442"></a><a href="#FNanchor_442"><span class="label">[442]</span></a> See the interesting study of the <cite>Corbaccio</cite> by <span class="smcap">Hauvette</span> in <cite>Bulletin
Italien</cite> (Bordeaux, 1901), Vol. I, No. I. Boccaccio says in the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>:
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">E primieramente la tua età, per la quale, se le tempie già bianche e la canuta
barba non m' ingannano, tu dovresti avere li costumi del mondo, fuor delle
fasce già sono degli anni quaranta e già venticinque, cominciatili a conoscere</span>"
(Ed. Moutier, 183). Hauvette interprets this: "Grown out of swaddling
clothes as you are these forty years, you have known the world for
twenty-five...." The majority of critics agree that the <cite>Corbaccio</cite> was
written <i>ca.</i> 1355, in which year Boccaccio was forty-two years old. Twenty-five
years before brings us to 1330, or almost to the dates on which he
(1) deserted trade, and (2) first saw Fiammetta. But in another place in the
same book he suggests that the book was written when the new year was
about to begin: "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">l' anno ... è tosto per entrar nuovo</span>," so that we may refer
this unfortunate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contretemps</i>, and the writing of the <cite>Corbaccio</cite> in consequence,
to December, 1355, i.e. February, 1356, new style, which brings us almost
exactly to March, 1331, the day of the meeting with Fiammetta.
</p>
<p>
As to the title of this book we know nothing. If it signifies the Evil Raven
and is derived from <i>corbo</i>, corvo, we cannot decide whether it refers to the
widow, or her husband, or to Boccaccio himself. On the other hand, it may
be derived from <i>corba</i> (Latin, corbis), a basket or trap, and this would be
explicable. All we know is that in by far the greater number of MSS.,
and these the oldest, the work bears the title <cite>Corbaccio</cite> or <cite>Corbaccino</cite>; but
whether this is owing to Boccaccio or not we cannot decide. The word does
not occur in the text. The copyists were certainly unaware of its significance,
and have always given it a sub-title, e.g. <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Corbaccio: libro del rimedio dello
amore, ... detto il Corbaccio</cite>, or <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corbaccius sive contra sceleratam viduam et
alias feminas invectivæ</cite>, or <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Corbaccio nimico delle femmine</cite>. The false title
<i>Laberinto d' amore</i> does not occur till the sixteenth century. Cf. <span class="smcap">Hauvette</span>,
<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 3. n. 1.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_443" id="Footnote_443"></a><a href="#FNanchor_443"><span class="label">[443]</span></a> The sources of this amazing and amusing book are not far to seek. In the
<cite>Divine Comedy</cite> it had been love which had let Dante out of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">selva oscura</i>;
here the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">selva oscura</i> is love and it is reason or experience who delivers
Boccaccio. Another source, as <span class="smcap">Pinelli</span>, <cite>Corbaccio</cite> in <cite>Propugnatore</cite>, XVI
(Bologna, 1883), pp. 169-92, has shown, is found in Giovenale. "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">L' imitazione</span>,"
says Pinelli, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">del Boccaccio non è pedestre, ma artifiziosa come
quella che cogliendo sempre il solo punto capitale del pensiero, e trascurando
la particolarità meno interessanti, aggiunge di suo tante inestimabili bellezze
da rendere l' opera originale</span>."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_444" id="Footnote_444"></a><a href="#FNanchor_444"><span class="label">[444]</span></a> We shall consider the <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita di Dante</cite> later when we discuss Boccaccio's
whole relation to Dante. It is necessary perhaps to decide here so far as we
can the date at which it was written. <span class="smcap">Baldelli</span> (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 378-9) tells us
that Buonmattei was of opinion that Boccaccio wrote the <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita di Dante</cite>
while he was still young. But Baldelli assures us that it must have been written
after the <cite>Ameto</cite> and before the <cite>Decameron</cite>, as its style is more pure and
formed than the one and less so than the other. The <cite>Decameron</cite> first
saw the light in 1353; and so Baldelli tells us the <cite>Vita</cite> was written in 1351.
On such a question no foreigner has a right to an opinion. But if I may
break my own rule, I shall say that I find myself in agreement with (among
others) <span class="smcap">Antona Traversi</span>, in his translation of Landau's life of Boccaccio
(<cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giovanni Boccaccio sua vita</cite>, etc. (Naples, 1882), p. 786, n. 3), when he says
that no really satisfactory conclusion can be arrived at on the evidence of a
prose style alone; for nothing is more fluid or more subject to mood, and
nothing, we might add, is more difficult to judge. Foscolo, with whom
Carducci finds himself in agreement, tells us that "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fra quante opere abbiamo
del Boccaccio la più luminosa di stile e di pensieri a me pare la</span> <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita di
Dante</cite>. Cf. <span class="smcap">Foscolo</span>, <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Discorso storico sul testo del Decameron</cite> (Lugano, 1828),
p. 94. But we need not admit so much to refute Baldelli. If the <cite>Decameron</cite>
was published in 1353, it was certainly begun some years, four or five at least,
before that. It is generally supposed, and with much reason, to have been
begun in 1348-9. But Baldelli gives the <cite>Vita</cite> to 1351. It follows then that
the work less pure in style than the <cite>Decameron</cite> was written two years after
the <cite>Decameron</cite> was begun. If we accept Baldelli's evidence we must conclude
that the <cite>Vita</cite> was written before 1348.
</p>
<p>
It seems extremely unlikely, however, that the <cite>Vita</cite> was written before
1353, for its whole tone, serious, even religious, and its extraordinary
antipathy to marriage and contempt for women are entirely out of keeping with
the eager love and sensuality of the <cite>Ameto</cite> and the gaiety of the <cite>Decameron</cite>.
It has, on the other hand, much in common with the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>, which belongs
to the years 1355 or 1356. With this conclusion Carducci&mdash;and no finer
critic ever lived&mdash;is in agreement. He agrees with <span class="smcap">Foscolo</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 14,
that the <cite>Corbaccio</cite> and the <cite>Vita di Dante</cite> were composed about the same time.
To establish the very year in which Boccaccio wrote the <cite>Vita</cite> seems to me
impossible. But I think it may be possible to prove that it was begun after
the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>, though not long after, let us say in 1356-7, and finished some
years later; according to <span class="smcap">Macri Leone</span> (<cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Vita di Dante</cite>, Firenze, 1888),
in 1363-4. We see in the <cite>Vita</cite> almost the same attitude towards women
that we have already found in the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>, but less fiercely bitter, more
reasoned, and less personal. But the immediate cause of Boccaccio's change
from an eager and self-flattering love of women to a hatred for and contempt
of them was his deception by the widow of the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>. We may psychologically
have been certain of this hatred from the first, for it is in fact a
logical development from his attitude to woman from his youth on; but
the immediate and provocative cause of the change was the perfidy of the
widow. It therefore seems to me that we must necessarily see in the <cite>Vita</cite> a
later work than the <cite>Corbaccio</cite>, though not so much later. Doubtless he had
been gathering facts all his life, and only in 1356-7 began to put them in
order. That it was so seems probable from the fact that the invective against
marriage is altogether an interpolation and has almost nothing to do with
Dante; it is in fact largely a quotation from a quotation of Jerome's.</p></div>

Boccaccio might prove "fortunate" to "these little sacred laurels." Boccaccio
had protested to Petrarch that he was not worthy of the name of poet.
Petrarch insisted that he was. "It is a strange thing," he says, "that you
should have aimed at being a poet only to shrink from the name." This affair
of the laurel may refer to that incident. "The laurel," says Boccaccio in

<p><a name="Footnote_474" id="Footnote_474"></a><a href="#FNanchor_474"><span class="label">[474]</span></a> Baldelli tells us that Pilatus left Boccaccio in 1362, but this is not so,
for they went together to see Petrarch in Venice in 1363 (see <i>infra</i>).
Baldelli's assertion is probably founded on the obscure and doubtful letter
of Boccaccio to Francesco Nelli (<span class="smcap">Corazzini</span>, p. 131), from which we learn that
Boccaccio went to Naples on the invitation of Acciaiuoli, as we suppose, in
1362. This letter, which is very long, is dated, according to Corazzini, August
28, 1363. Now before September 7, 1363, Nelli was dead of the plague in
Naples, as appears from Petrarch's letter (<cite>Sen.</cite>, III, i., September 7, 1363).
<span class="smcap">Hortis</span> (<cite>Studi</cite>, p. 20, n. 3) is of opinion that this letter is apocryphal.
<span class="smcap">Todeschini</span> (<cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Opinione sulla epistola del priore di S. Apostolo [sic] attribuita al
Boccaccio</cite>, Venice, 1832) convinced Hortis of this. Todeschini does not
believe in this visit to Naples, and in fact the only notice we have of it is
contained in the letter he discards. His arguments are as follows. Until
May, 1362, Boccaccio dwelt certainly in Tuscany, where in 1361, or more
probably in 1362, Ciani visited him, and whence he wrote Petrarch the letter
we have lost to which Petrarch replied in the noble letter I have cited above
(<cite>Sen.</cite>, I, 5) on May 28, 1362. (Cf. <span class="smcap">Fracassetti's</span> note to this letter.) It is not
possible that Boccaccio can have been in Naples between the autumn of 1361
and May, 1362, because he himself tells us that for three years he was with
Pilatus, who enjoyed his hospitality and from whom he learned to understand
Homer. Now it is certain that he did not know Pilatus before 1360, and was
with him till 1363, when, as we shall see, they visited Petrarch together in
Venice. (Cf. <span class="smcap">Fracassetti</span> his note to <cite>Fam.</cite>, XVIII, 2.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_475" id="Footnote_475"></a><a href="#FNanchor_475"><span class="label">[475]</span></a> This visit must have been between March 13 and September 7, 1363, on
both of which dates Petrarch wrote to him. The letter of September 7
seems to have been written immediately after his departure (<cite>Senili</cite>, II, 1,
and III, 1). Cf. also <span class="smcap">De Nohlac</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 102. Cf. also Boccaccio's

1366, thanking the Republic for the letters with which Francesco Bruni had
acquainted him, especially for soliciting him to return to Italy. He says he
is determined to return for the good of the Church and of Italy, and particularly
of Florence, who has shown herself so devoted to the Holy See. <i>Ibid.</i>

<p><a name="Footnote_491" id="Footnote_491"></a><a href="#FNanchor_491"><span class="label">[491]</span></a> The Eclogue XIV tells us much that otherwise we should never have known
as to Boccaccio's children. It is there we hear of his little daughter Violante,
whom he there calls Olympia, and who died "at an age when one goes straight
to heaven." "Pro Olympia," he says, in the letter already quoted, to Matteo da
Signa, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">intelligo parvulam filiam meam olim mortuam, ea in ætate, in
qua morientes cœlestes effici cives credimus; et ideo ex Violante cum viveret,
mortuam <em>cœlestem</em> idest <em>Olympiam</em> voco</span>." Boccaccio conceived this Eclogue
in a wood, and therefore he calls himself Silvio. The Eclogue roughly
is as follows: Boccaccio in a sleepless and restless night full of unhappy
regrets longs for the day. Suddenly a light illumines all and he hears a
singing. It is the voice of Violante (Olympia), who salutes her father.
"Fear not," she says, "I am thy daughter. Why should you be afraid?
Canst thou doubt? Dost thou think that Violante would deceive her father?
I come to thee to sweeten thy sorrow." To her Boccaccio (Silvio) answers:
"I recognise thee, love does not deceive me nor my dreams; O my great
delight, only hope of thy father. What god has taken thee from me, O my
little daughter? They told me when I returned to Naples thou wert dead,
and believing this, how long, how long I wept for thee, how long, how long I
mourned thee, calling thee back to me. But what splendour surrounds thee;
who are thy companions? O marvel, that in such a little space of time you
should have grown so, for you seem, little daughter mine, to be already
marriageable." And Violante answers: "It was but my earthly vesture
that, dear, you buried in the lap of earth. These vestments, this form, this
resplendent body the Madonna herself has given me. But look on my
companions, have you never seen them?" And Boccaccio: "I do not
remember them, but neither Narcissus, nor Daphnis, nor Alexis were more
beautiful." And Violante: "And dost thou not recognise thy Mario, thy
Giulio, and my sweet sisters? They are thy children." And Boccaccio:
"Come, O children mine, whom I have held in my arms, on my breast, and
with glad kisses heal my heart. Let us make a joyful <i>festa</i>, and intone a
hymn of joy. Let the wood be silent, and let Arno run noiselessly." Then
follows a hymn sung by Violante in honour of Jesus Christ (Codro) and of
the Blessed Virgin: the most beautiful of all Boccaccio's Latin songs. And
Violante departs promising, when her father will hardly let her go, that he
shall soon be with her for ever in heaven.
</p>
<p>
We see here that Boccaccio had two sons, Giulio and Mario, and at least
three daughters, Violante and her sisters.</p></div>

generally said that he went again to the Pope in November, 1367. <span class="smcap">Mazzucchelli</span>,

have gone to see the Pope in Avignon in November, 1367, for the Pontiff
set out for Italy on April 30, as we have seen. In December, 1368, as we
shall see, Pope Urban in Rome wrote to the Signoria di Firenze in praise of
Boccaccio. It seems certain, then, that Boccaccio went on embassy to Rome

<p><a name="Footnote_498" id="Footnote_498"></a><a href="#FNanchor_498"><span class="label">[498]</span></a> Boccaccio does not forget to ask him for the return of his Tacitus, and
thus shows us that he possessed the works of this historian, which he not
seldom quotes in the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Genealogiis Deorum</cite>. Cf. <span class="smcap">Hortis</span>, <cite>Studi</cite>, pp. 424-6,
and <span class="smcap">Paget Toynbee</span>, <cite>Boccaccio's Commentary on the Divine Comedy</cite> in
<cite>Modern Language Review</cite> (Cambridge, 1907), Vol. II, No. 2, p. 119. Boccaccio
was certainly acquainted with the twelfth to the sixteenth books of the
<cite>Annals</cite> and the second and third books of the <cite>Histories</cite>. How did he come
into possession of this treasure? <span class="smcap">Hortis</span> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) suggests that he found
the MS. when he paid his famous visit (when we do not know) to the Badia
of Monte Cassino. It is Benvenuto da Imola, Boccaccio's disciple, who tells us
of this visit. "My reverend master Boccaccio," he says in his Commentary
on the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, Paradiso, xxii. 74, "told me that, being once in the
neighbourhood of Monte Cassino, he paid the monastery a visit and asked if
he might see the library. Whereupon one of the monks, pointing to a staircase,
said gruffly, 'Go up; it is open.' Boccaccio went up and saw to his
astonishment that the library, the storehouse of the monastic treasures, had
neither door nor fastening; and on entering in he found grass growing on the
windows and all the books and benches buried in dust. When he came to
turn over the books, some of which were very rare and of great value, he
discovered that many of them had been mutilated and defaced by having
leaves torn out or the margins cut&mdash;a discovery which greatly distressed him.
In answer to his enquiries as to how this damage had been caused, he was
told that it was the work of some of the monks themselves. These vandals,
desirous of making a little money, were in the habit of tearing out leaves from
some of the MSS. and of cutting the margins off others, for the purpose of
converting them into psalters and breviaries which they afterwards sold" (see
<span class="smcap">Paget Toynbee</span>, <cite>Dante Studies and Researches</cite> (Methuen, 1902), p. 233 <i>et
seq.</i>) Boccaccio does not seem to have shown his MS. to Petrarch, who
nowhere quotes Tacitus or shows us that he knows him.</p></div>

wrote during these years: that to Matteo d' Ambrosio, dated "iv Idus
Maias," which <span class="smcap">Hortis</span> (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 285) argues belongs to 1371; that to
Orsini, which the same critic gives to June, 1371; that to Jacopo da Pizzinghe,
which he gives to the summer of the same year; and that to Piero di Monteforte,
dated from Certaldo "Nonis Aprilis," which he gives to 1372. <span class="smcap">Baldelli</span>,
followed by <span class="smcap">Witte</span> (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. xl), thinks the letter to Matteo d' Ambrosio
belongs to 1373, and thus argues that Boccaccio was twice in Naples:
in the winter of 1370-1, and again in the autumn of 1372 to May, 1373. But
Hortis shows it is impossible that the letter to Ambrosio is of May, 1373, since
on 19 March, 1373, Boccaccio was in Certaldo when the Bishop Angelo
Acciaiuoli committed to him an office&mdash;"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">confidens quam plurimum de fidei

Petrarch there says: "The book you have composed in our maternal tongue,
probably during your youth, has fallen into my hands, I do not know by what
chance. I have seen it, but if I should say I had read it I should lie. The
work is very long, and it is written for the vulgar, that is to say in prose.
Besides, I have been overwhelmed with occupations, and I have had only
very little time, for as you know, one was then at the mercy of all the troubles
of the war, and although I was not interested in them, I could not be insensible
to the troubles of the republic. I have, then, run through this volume like a
hurried traveller who just looks but does not stop.... I have had much
pleasure in turning its leaves. Certain passages, a little free, are excused by
the age at which you wrote it&mdash;the style, the idiom, the lightness of the subject
and of the readers you had in view. It is essential to know for whom
one is writing, and the difference in the characters of people justifies a difference
in style. Besides a crowd of things light and pleasant, I have found
there others both edifying and serious; but not having read the complete
work, I cannot give you a definite judgment on it." We shall consider this
letter again later in my chapter on the <cite>Decameron</cite> (see <i>infra</i>, <a href="#Page_311">p. 311</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_519" id="Footnote_519"></a><a href="#FNanchor_519"><span class="label">[519]</span></a> As for Petrarch's contempt for Italian, see <cite>Senil.</cite>, V, 2. Petrarch there
says to Boccaccio, that Donato degli Albanzani "tells me that in your youth
you were singularly pleased to write in the vulgar, and that you spent much
time on it." He adds that Boccaccio had then composed the same kind of
work as he himself had done, apparently referring to the <cite>Rime</cite>. He seems
to refuse to consider the prose works in the vulgar as being literature at all.
It is probable even that the accusation that he disliked and envied Dante,
from which he so warmly defends him (cf. <cite>Fam.</cite>, XXI, 15), had this much
truth, that he disliked the language of the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> in his absurd
worship of Latin. But though he could not see it, the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>
is the first work of the Renaissance just because it is written not in
Latin, the language of the Church, but in Italian, the language of the
people. There lay the destruction of the Middle Age and the tyranny of the
Ecclesiastic. For with the rise of the vulgar rose Nationalism, which, with
the invention of printing, eventually destroyed the real power of the Church.
It was a question of knowledge, of education, of the power of development
and life.</p></div>

Introduction to the <cite>Comento</cite> tells us, mistakenly, that Boccaccio lectured in
S. Stefano al Ponte Vecchio. This church, since the church of S. Cecilia was
destroyed in Piazza Signoria at the end of the eighteenth century, has been
called SS. Stefano e Cecilia, but from the thirteenth century till then it was
called S. Stefano <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad portam ferram</i>. That it was not here but at S. Stefano
della Badia that Boccaccio lectured we know from Monaldi's diary, and it is
confirmed for us by Benvenuto da Imola: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In interiori circulo est Abbatia
monachorum sancti Benedicti, cuius ecclesia dicitur Sanctus Stephanus, ubi
certius et ordinatius pulsabantur horæ quam in aliqua alia ecclesia civitatis;
quæ tamen hodie est inordinata et neglecta, ut vidi, dum audirem venerabilem
præceptorem meum Boccaccium de Certaldo legentem istum nobilem poetam
in dicta ecclesia</span>" (<cite>Comentum</cite> (ed. Vernon), Vol. V, p. 145). Dr. Toynbee
thinks that S. Stefano is the ancient dedication of the Badia, which was later
placed under the protection of S. Mary. If this was so, then it was in the
Badia itself that Boccaccio lectured. Mr. Carmichael, however (<cite>On the
Old Road through France to Florence</cite> (Murray), p. 254), states that Boccaccio
lectured not in the abbey, but in the little church of S. Stefano ad Abbatiam,
formerly adjoining the abbey, and indeed almost a part of it. Unfortunately
he gives no authority for this important statement, nor can he now give
any. It is, however, a very interesting suggestion, worth examining
closely.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_584" id="Footnote_584"></a><a href="#FNanchor_584"><span class="label">[584]</span></a> It must be observed that the <cite>Vita</cite> appears in many forms, but it will be
enough for us to consider the two principal, both of which claim to be by
Boccaccio. The whole question is thoroughly dealt with by <span class="smcap">Macri Leone</span> in
his edition of the <cite>Vita</cite> (Firenze, 1888), and more briefly by <span class="smcap">Witte</span>, <cite>The two
versions of Boccaccio's life of Dante</cite> in <cite>Essays on Dante</cite> (London, 1898), p.
262 <i>et seq.</i>, and by Dr. <span class="smcap">E. Moore</span>, <cite>Dante and his early Biographers</cite>
(London, 1890).
</p>
<p>
Of these two versions the longer we shall call the <cite>Vita</cite>, the shorter the
<cite>Compendio</cite>, but the latter is by no means a mere epitome of the former, for
some of the episodes are more fully treated in it, while others are ignored. We
shall find ourselves in agreement with the great majority of modern critics if we
regard the <cite>Vita</cite> as the original and the <cite>Compendio</cite> as a modification of it
executed either by Boccaccio or by another, and if we assert that the <cite>Vita</cite> is
by Boccaccio and the <cite>Compendio</cite> an unauthorised redraft of it, we shall be
supported not only by so great an authority as <span class="smcap">Macri Leone</span>, but by Biscioni,
Pelli, Tiraboschi, Gamba, Baldelli, Foscolo, Paur, Witte (who hesitates to
condemn the <cite>Compendio</cite> altogether), Scartazzini, Koerting, and Dr. Moore.
On the other hand, Dionisi and Mussi held that the <cite>Compendio</cite> was the
original and the <cite>Vita</cite> a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rifacimento</i>; while Schaeffer-Boichorst thought both
to be the work of Boccaccio, the <cite>Vita</cite> being the original; and the editors
of the Paduan edition of the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> (1822) thought both to be
genuine, but the <cite>Compendio</cite> the first draft. Dr. Witte enters into the
differences between the two, printing passages in parallel columns; Macri
Leone is even fuller in his comparison; Dr. Moore also compares them.
Briefly we may say that the <cite>Compendio</cite> is shorter, that it "hedges" when it
can and softens and abbreviates the denunciation of Florence, and omits much:
e.g. the <cite>Vita's</cite> assertion of Dante's devotion to Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Statius,
while inserting certain personal suggestions: e.g. that in his later years Dante
having quite recovered from his love for Beatrice ran after other women
especially in his exile in Lucca, where he became enamoured of a young girl
called Pargoletta, and in the Casentino of another who "had a pretty face but
was afflicted with a goitre." As for Pargoletta, it is not a proper name at all,
as Boccaccio knew, for in the same chapter of the <cite>Vita</cite> he writes: "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">in sua
pargoletta età</span>." He was incapable of falling into this error, which apparently
arose from a confusion of <cite>Purgatorio</cite>, XXIV, 34-6, and XXXI, 59. In the
<cite>Compendio</cite> the attacks on marriage are not less bitter, only whereas in the
<cite>Vita</cite> they are only against marriage in general, in the <cite>Compendio</cite> we get an
amusing description of the hindrances to Dante's studies caused by his wife's
complaints of his solitary habits and her absurd interruptions of his meditations
by asking him to pay nurse's wages and see to children's clothes. The
<cite>Compendio</cite> too in all matters concerning Dante's contemporaries is more vague.
Thus the <cite>Vita</cite> (possibly wrongly) tells us that in Verona Dante took refuge
with Alberto della Scala; the <cite>Compendio</cite>, more cautious, says with the
"Signore della terra." It also omits the stories concerning Dante at Siena and
Paris, and entirely remodels the digressions in chapters ix. and x. of the <cite>Vita</cite> on
Poetry. It omits the extremely characteristic excuse for lechery of the <cite>Vita</cite> and
omits all dates: e.g. that Dante began the <cite>Vita Nuova</cite> in his twenty-sixth year,
as well as the assertion that he was in his later years ashamed of it. There are
many other differences also. But it might seem impossible in the face of the
evidence brought forward by Macri Leone and others to doubt that the <cite>Vita</cite> is
Boccaccio's work and not the <cite>Compendio</cite>. We shall therefore here leave the
latter and devote ourselves to the former, only remarking that if Boccaccio
wrote the <cite>Vita</cite> it is improbable that he wrote another work on the same
subject, since, if he did so, it must have been written in the last two years of
his life, for only one work is referred to by him in the <cite>Comento</cite>, viz. the
<cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trattatello in lode di Dante</cite>. We consider then the <cite>Compendio</cite> as a
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rifacimento</i> not from Boccaccio's hand. The evidence is thoroughly sifted by
<span class="smcap">Macri Leone</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, whom the reader should consult for a complete
treatment of the matter.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_587" id="Footnote_587"></a><a href="#FNanchor_587"><span class="label">[587]</span></a> As Mr. Wicksteed's translation is the version of the <cite>Vita</cite> most likely to
come into the hands of English readers, I propose here to traverse his "warnings"
and "cautions." Whatever scholars may "appear to be settling down
to," this at least is certain, that of writers upon Dante, Boccaccio is the only
one who in professing to write a life can have had absolutely first-hand evidence.
The points that Mr. Wicksteed wishes to warn us against are three. Boccaccio
asserts that Dante was licentious, that he was a bitter political partisan, and
that when he had once left Gemma he never returned to her or allowed her
to follow him. In order that we may be quite sure what Boccaccio says, as
well as what Mr. Wicksteed thinks he says, I quote Mr. Wicksteed's translation
(p. 79): "... there was no fiercer Ghibelline than he, nor more opposed
to the Guelfs. And that for which I most blush, in the interest of his memory,
is that in Romagna it is matter of greatest notoriety that any feeble woman
or little child who had but spoken, in party talk, in condemnation of the
Ghibelline faction would have stirred him to such madness as to move him to
hurl stones at such, had they not held their peace; and in such bitterness he
lived even until his death. And assuredly I blush <em>to be forced</em> to taint the
fame of such a man with any defect; but the order of things on which I have
begun in some sort demands it; <em>because that if I hold my peace concerning
those things in him which are less worthy of praise</em>, I shall withdraw much
faith from the praiseworthy things already recounted. So do I plead my
excuse to him himself, who perchance, even as I write, looketh down with scornful
eye from some lofty region of heaven. Amid all the virtue, amid all the
knowledge that hath been shown above to have belonged to this wondrous
poet, lechery found most ample place not only in the years of his youth, but
also of his maturity; the which vice, though it be natural and common and
scarce to be avoided, yet in truth is so far from being commendable that it
cannot even be suitably excused. But who amongst mortals shall be a righteous
judge to condemn it? Not I. Oh, the impurity, oh, the brutish appetite
of men." The passage as to Gemma will be found at the end of the
interpolation against marriage (p. 27), at the end of which he says: "Assuredly
I do not affirm that these things chanced to Dante; for I do not
know it; <em>though true it is</em> that (whether such like things or others were
the cause) when once he had parted from her [Gemma] who had been given
him as a consolation in his sufferings! never would he go where she was, nor
suffer her to come to where he was, albeit he was the father of several children
by her." Let us take these things in order.
</p>
<p>
Boccaccio asserts, much to Mr. Wicksteed's distress, it seems, that Dante
was a bitter and intolerant politician. He will have none of it. Well, let
Dante speak for himself. When he hails as the "Lamb of God" a German
king whom the Guelfs defeated and most probably poisoned; when he speaks
of Florence, the Guelf city, as "the rank fox that lurketh in hiding, the
beast that drinketh from the Arno, polluting its waters with its jaws, the
viper that stings its mother's heart, the black sheep that corrupts the whole
flock, the Myrrha guilty of incest with her father," according to Mr. Wicksteed,
we ought not to consider him a bitter politician at all; indeed only an
"ill-informed" and "superficial" person like Boccaccio would call him so.
To ordinary men, however, such semi-scholastic, semi-Biblico-classical language
sounds like politics, and fierce party politics too, and one cannot
conceive what other explanation Mr. Wicksteed would offer us of it.
Mr. Wicksteed tells us that when Boccaccio declares that it was well
known in Romagna that he would have flung stones at any who "in party
talk had but spoken in condemnation of the Ghibelline cause" he was
speaking figuratively. Perhaps so; but I doubt if Mr. Wicksteed, had
he had the happiness to be a Guelf, would have cared to put Dante to the
proof. And we may well ask what would have deterred the man, who in hell
thought it virtuous to cheat Frate Alberigo and leave him blinded by his
frozen tears, from hurling a few stones on behalf of his cause?
</p>
<p>
Nor is Mr. Wicksteed any more ready to believe that Dante was a lover
of women. When Boccaccio tells us that Dante fell into the sin of lechery
not only in his youth but in his maturity, it is on the face of it certain that
he is compelled to say so, that he has irrefutable evidence for it, since he
excuses himself for the necessity of his assertion. Nor is there a tittle of
evidence to refute Boccaccio. Mr. Wicksteed, like a good Protestant, prefers
his own private judgment. He prefers to think of Dante as in all respects
what he would have him. "On the whole," he says, "I think the student
may safely form his own judgment from the material in his hands [viz.
Dante's own works, I think] <em>without attaching any authoritative significance
whatever to Boccaccio's assertion. It is safe to go even a step further and to say
that the dominating impression which that assertion leaves is definitely false</em>...!"
It is clear that Mr. Wicksteed is not going to allow Boccaccio to
involve Dante in any of his <cite>Decameron</cite> stories!
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wicksteed is equally indignant that Boccaccio should have asserted
that Dante when he parted from Gemma never returned to her nor suffered
her to come to him. It seems, then, that Dante too must become a respectable
and sedate person in the modern middle-class manner. He was not a bitter
party politician; he was not a lover of women; far from it: he lived as peaceably
and continuously as circumstances allowed him with his wife, whom he cherished
with all the tenderness we might expect of a nature so docile, so well controlled,
and so considerate of the sin and weakness of others. "What was
Boccaccio's source of information as to Dante and Gemma never having met
after the former's exile," Mr. Wicksteed angrily declares, "it is impossible
to say." But that does not invalidate the statement. What is Mr. Wicksteed's
source of doubt? Is there any evidence that they did meet? And if they
did not, why curse Boccaccio? Boccaccio tells us they never did meet. Yet
having no evidence at all to offer us in the matter Mr. Wicksteed has the
extraordinary temerity to close his tirade, one cannot call it an argument, by
this weird confession: "It would be straining the evidence [? what evidence]
to say that we can establish a positive case on the other side." I agree
with him; it would, it would. But enough! Such is the virtue of certain
prepossessions that, though the sun be as full of spots as a housewife's pudding
is full of raisins, if it please us not we will deny it.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_593" id="Footnote_593"></a><a href="#FNanchor_593"><span class="label">[593]</span></a> He treats of the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> more fully than of the rest. "The question
is moved at large by many men, and amongst them sapient ones," he
writes, "why Dante, a man perfectly versed in knowledge, chose to write in
the Florentine idiom so grand a work, of such exalted matter and so notable
as this comedy; and why not rather in Latin verses, as other poets before him
had done. In reply to which question, two chief reasons, amongst many
others, come to my mind. The first of which is that he might be of more
general use to his fellow-citizens and the other Italians; for he knew that if
he had written metrically in Latin, as the other poets of past times had done,
he would only have done service to men of letters, whereas writing in the
vernacular he did a deed ne'er done before, and (without any let to men of
letters whereby they should not understand him) showing the beauty of our
idiom and his own excelling art therein, gave delight and understanding of
himself to the unlearned, who had hitherto been abandoned of every one. The
second reason which moved him thereto was this: seeing that liberal studies
were utterly abandoned, and especially by the princes and other great men,
to whom poetic toils were wont to be dedicated (wherefore the divine works
of Virgil and the other poets had not only sunk into neglect, but well nigh
into contempt at the hands of many), having himself begun, according as the
loftiness of the matter demanded, after this guise&mdash;

<p>he abandoned it; for he conceived it was a vain thing to put crusts of bread
into the mouths of such as were still sucking milk; wherefore he began his
work again in style suited to modern tastes, and followed it up in the vernacular."
He adds that Dante, "as some maintain," dedicated the <cite>Inferno</cite>
to Uguccione della Faggiuola, the <cite>Purgatorio</cite> to Marquis Moruello Malespina,
and the <cite>Paradiso</cite> to Frederic third King of Sicily; but as others assert, the

the question.</p></div>

Pogetto or della Campora outside the walls of Florence "all and singular
Holy Relics which the said dominus Johannes in a great while and with
much labour has procured from divers parts of the world." (S. Maria della
Campora is outside the Porta Romana of Florence; there are still frescoes of
the school of Giotto there.) To the church of S. Jacopo of Certaldo he
leaves an alabaster plaque of the Blessed Virgin, a chasuble, stole, and
maniple of red silk, and a small altar pallium of red Lucca cloth, an altar
cushion of the same cloth, and three cases for corporals; a vase of pewter for
holy water, and a small cloak of yellow silk and cloth. He leaves a diptych
in which is painted on the one side Our Lady with her Son in her arms and
on the other a skull to Madonna Sandra, "who to-day is wife of Franciesco
di Lapo Buonamichi." This extraordinary collection of things, which would
only be in place in the house of a priest one might think, leads us to ask whether
Boccaccio had received any Order. We cannot answer. Suares says he saw
a papal bull that permitted him to receive Holy Orders in spite of his illegitimacy,
and in his Will he is called "Dominus" and "Venerabilis." It is
perhaps in place to note that, like Dante and S. Francis, Boccaccio has been
claimed as a Protestant born out of due time. This amazing nonsense was
set forth in a book by one <span class="smcap">Hager</span>, entitled <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Programmata III de Joanne

Some time since Mr. Algar Thorold published a fine translation of <cite>The
Dialogue of S. Catherine of Siena</cite> (Kegan Paul), and here all the evidence
needed can be found. But of late a "new edition" (1907) has appeared
with the respectable "imprimatur" of the Catholic authorities, but all the
evidence against the clergy has been omitted, probably to obtain the "imprimatur."
See <i>infra</i> <a href="#Footnote_682">p. 310, n. 1.</a> S. Catherine's impeachment of the
clergy will be found in the section of her book called <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Trattato delle

excellent <cite>S. Catherine of Siena</cite> (Dent, 1907), p. 361 <i>et seq.</i> Mr. Gardner adds

Boccaccio's <cite>Decameron</cite> is confirmed by the burning words of a great saint."</p></div>

(Firenze, 1850), III. The facts seem quite clear about the action of the
Church with regard to the <cite>Decameron</cite>. It was condemned by the Council of
Trent. The earliest edition of the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Index Librorum Prohibitorum</cite> in which
I have found it, is that published in Rome in 1559. Since then it has
figured in every Roman edition of the Index (as far as I have tested them),
the entry against it being "Donec expurg. Ind. Trent," which means,
"Until expurgated, indexed by the Council of Trent." It appears to have
remained thus provisionally condemned and prohibited until the last years of
the nineteenth century. I find it still in the Index of 1881; but it no longer
figures in that of 1900. The amusing point is that the Church does not seem
to have minded the licentiousness of the tales as such; but to have objected
to them being told of Monks, Friars, Nuns, and the Clergy, in regard to
whom, as we have seen, they were merely the truth. Editions with a clerical
"imprimatur" have been always published where laymen have been substituted
for these. For instance, the edition printed in Florence, 1587, "con
permissione de' superiori," etc., substitutes the avarice of magistrates for the
hypocrisy of the clergy in <cite>Dec.</cite>, I, 6.</p></div>

<cite>Troilus and Criseyde</cite> is to a great extent a translation of the <cite>Filostrato</cite>.
Cf. <span class="smcap">Rossetti, W. M</span>., <cite>Chaucer's "Troylus and Criseyde" compared with
Boccaccio's "Filostrato"</cite> (Chaucer Society, 1875 and 1883). The <cite>Knightes Tale</cite>
is a free rendering of the <cite>Teseide</cite>. The design of the <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite> was
in some sort modelled on the design of the <cite>Decameron</cite>. As we have seen,
<cite>The Reeves Tale</cite>, <cite>The Frankeleynes Tale</cite>, <cite>The Schipmannes Tale</cite> are all found
in the <cite>Decameron</cite>, though it is doubtful perhaps whether Chaucer got them
thence. <cite>The Monks Tale</cite> is from <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Casibus Virorum</cite>.

<p>
Did Chaucer meet Petrarch and Boccaccio in Italy? He seems to wish to
suggest that he had met the former at Padua, but, as I have said, of the latter
he says not a word, but gives "Lollius" as his authority when he uses
Boccaccio's work. Cf. Dr. <span class="smcap">Koch's</span> paper in <cite>Chaucer Society Essays</cite>, Pt. IV.

<p class="large">TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Modern practice in Italian texts contracts (removes the space from)
vowel elisions, for example l'anno not l' anno, ch'io not ch' io.
This book, in common with some similar English books of the time, has
a space in these elisions in the original text.  This space has been
retained in the etext.  The only exceptions, in both the text and
etext, are in French names and phrases, such as d'Aquino and d'Anjou.</p>

<p>Except for those changes noted below, misspelling by the author,
and inconsistent or archaic usage, has been retained. For example,
well known, well-known; Africo, Affrico.</p>
